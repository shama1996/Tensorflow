       "['I work in IT, so knowing the specs, I wasn\\'t expecting anything brilliant. That being said, I intended to use this machine for casual tasks like reading, or watching YouTube, maybe writing a few docs here and there. The usual. That being said, This laptop is stupid slow for 2021. The display is not great. It is like looking through some kind of mesh screen lol. I tried playing some YouTube videos, and, well, they played with some buffering and graininess. The audio is not the best, but \"it works\". Other than that, I think the worst part about this thing is the construction quality. I press the plastic in a little near the mouse pad, and it creaks. I try to open and close the lid, and it makes this terrible creaking, plasticky snapping noise that makes me scared to open or close the laptop at all. I think for 250 dollars, you are better off with a Chromebook or finding something else used. I would say this is ok as a last resort, but honestly it wasn\\'t even worth only a day\\'s wait. This was a box of disappointment, and makes me question if I should ever try one of Hyundai\\'s cars....Ewwww',\n",

       " \"If you are buying this and planning on using Windows 7, Linux, Chrome OS, or Android, you're golden. If you want to use Windows 10, don't buy this laptop.\",\n",
       " \"This is my first ever PC and I'm loving it so far. Overall, this is a really great product, but I do have a few minor complaints.\\n1) Some of the buttons on the keyboard (left shift and space) are a bit messed up. The right side of one of my shifts is noticeably down-turned and is a bit harder to press because of this if you're typing quickly. The top corners of the space bar are also up turned, but this doesn't affect usage.\\n2) (This only happened once as of yet) When I'm on the web, all my tabs just freeze. This isn't a major problem though, as all you need to do to fix it is restart the device.\\nFirst reactions:\\nRight out of the box, this thing is sleek and lightweight and very satisfying to look at. The laptop is super easy and quick to set up. Within minutes, I was into the home screen of the product and customizing away. There are a lot of really expensive laptops out there that cost way more and do the same thing, so if you're trying to find your first PC, I would highly recommend this. Here are some more high points about this product:\\n1) Low price for high quality product (In my opinion)\\n2) Intel core processor\\n3) Personally, I find the click of the touchpad very satisfying\\n4) You can make digital art (with drawing tablet)\\n5) Would make an amazing laptop for a birthday or Christmas present\\n\\nHope this helps!\",\n",

       " 'This 14” laptop is a nice value, and offers good enough performance to handle web browsing, video streaming, document/Office editing tasks. What I like about it is the unique hardware, such as the numpad mode integrated into the touchpad (it’s a clever use of space on a compact design), and the privacy sliding cover on the webcam. It also packs above average specs compared to other models I looked at in this price segment, including 6GB of RAM (more than the typical 4GB for budget laptops), a FHD display with pretty good viewing angles, and a decent processor (J3455 is quad core, and almost 2 times faster than the more common N3350 in benchmarks). Pretty good overall!\\n\\nPros:\\n- Laptop feels sturdy and well put together, closes magnetically, sharp angular design looks more expensive than expected. I also really like the blue color, sets it apart from the crowd.\\n- SSD storage is upgradable using M2 SATA slot, by removing the back cover\\n- Nice selection of I/O for a thin laptop, including 2 USB 3.0 ports & micro SD slot\\n- Keyboard feels responsive to type on, touchpad is also working well for me\\n- Display is matte instead of glossy, which doesn’t reflect too much light, helping it remain visible in most environments I tried it in.\\n- It’s a fanless (silent) computer, so there’s no noise in the background, and remains pretty cool during usage.\\n- Battery life is decent, getting me around 5-6 hours per charge on moderate settings (the performance of the processor can be adjusted under battery settings).\\n- Amount of RAM is sufficient for comfortable web browsing, including opening 10 tabs in the browser, or doing some multitasking.\\n- General system navigation felt snappy, probably due to the SSD (boot up times are also quite fast).\\n- Runs on full Windows 10 operating system, so can easily install other legacy programs (unlike with Chrome OS).\\n\\nCons:\\n- Ultimately still an energy efficient laptop, so might not be a replacement for a gaming machine. However, for all other regular tasks, it’s a great choice to carry around and use for entertainment & office work.\\n- As is the norm at this price point, the charging isn’t USB-C (nor is the keyboard backlit), but that’s to be expected. Still a solid device overall and a good Chromebook alternative!',\n",
       " ' I have been in need of a laptop for daily computing tasks for a while. My needs are fairly basic... mostly I needed something for working on spreadsheets and documents, browsing the internet a bit and streaming. This is a basic machine, at a reasonable price, that is able to perform the aforementioned tasks I need.\\n\\nThe N3350 is an entry level CPU with 1.1GHz base frequency and up to 2.4GHz burst. While low ranking on benchmark tests against other CPUs, it is still quite capable of doing what I need. They have it paired with a 128GB ssd for faster performance and 6GB of RAM. To further optimize the performance of the laptop it arrives running Windows in S mode. This is basically a Windows version of a Chromebook which optimizes the performance, keeping the familiar windows experience. In S-mode I am limited to apps from the windows store, but that is fine for my purposes. If one does want to switch to regular windows 10, that can be downloaded for free with this copy of Windows from the Microsoft store.\\n\\nThe battery life is quite acceptable at around 6-7 hours. One of the nice things about the N3350 CPU is its low power consumption for extended battery life. That low power consumption also makes it cool running, hence this laptop is able to operate without a fan. It is a nice feeling laptop to use because it doesn’t get hot and and is absolutely quiet running without a fan.\\n\\nI find that this laptop has good tactile feel to type on. The display is large, crisp and bright for a pleasant user experience. Another feature I like is the numpad option that is built into the touchpad. I do a lot of work with spreadsheets so that is pretty handy for me. It is turned on easily by touching the “slide” button on the left side of the trackpad and sliding down to the spreadsheet icon. When done using the numpad, the trackpad is turned back on by swiping up from the “slide” button. The keyboard does still have the traditional numlock option if one prefers. That is available through the function keys as well as other common controls such as volume. Regarding sound, I find it to be quite good from this laptop on its own. One does have the option to either use auxiliary or Bluetooth speakers or headphones if preferred. The camera quality is also good and even has face tracking and autofocus. When not in use, I really find the built in cover for the webcam unique and handy. I have never seen that before on a laptop and do use it for my peace of mind when not using the camera.\\n\\nSince most of the work that I do on this laptop is web based, having good internet connectivity is important to me. That was what I worried about most with the performance but it has been absolutely fine. I’m able to load my one drive documents quickly, browse the web and stream videos smoothly.\\n\\nOverall, I am quite happy with this laptop. It is lightweight and portable to go with me wherever I need to work. I find myself needing to be quite flexible with my working location these days with kids doing school from home.

       " \"I haven't seen many reviews for this particular CPU/model. I have been using this laptop to work from home for about a week now, which means I keep it plugged in on my desk and on for 8+ hours a day while I work with spreadsheets and email clients. Numerous reviews for the i5-10210 CPU mentioned the terrible fan noise and low sound quality, but I haven't experienced either of those issues with i5-1035G1. The fan does turn on sometimes when I'm not heavily using the laptop, but it doesn't stay on long and it's not very loud. I play workout videos on the laptop and am very pleased with sound and video quality. For reference, I had an i3 Asus laptop for nine years before getting this one, so my standards are kind of low because my old one was so much heavier, clunkier, slower, etc. Nevertheless, this seems fantastic for what I need it to do, which is mainly to facilitate my work-from-home experience. Since it has only been a week my experience is limited, so if anything goes catastrophically wrong I will update my review. Fingers crossed...\\n\\n**EDIT**November 18, 2020: Still a great laptop.

       " 'This is my third Acer laptop (other 2 are still functional) and after 2 weeks this has been a solid performer. Performs well and with WiFi 6 I am getting superb speed using 5 GHz network. Battery life has been good so far. I will say that compared to my Aspire E laptop the keyboard is slimmer, and the number pad keys and functions keys are smaller but there is nice tactile feedback on the keys and the back lighting is nice.\\n\\nWhat has been difficult is getting proper information about configuration. Like some other reviews, my laptop came with 1 8 GB memory stick rather than a 4 + 4 configuration. So this laptop maxes out at only 16 GB of RAM, and you are limited to using only Kingston memory (per Acer and my own testing). So that was a bit of a bummer.\\n\\nI was able to add a second SDD (I used WD Blue b/c of price) which is always a nice feature of the Acer laptops. This was more difficult than my Aspire E laptops but still doable. The trick is to remove the screw holding the Intel chip down so you can fully seat the connector.',\n",

The system is upgradeable - I upgraded the M.2 SSD from the standard 256 GB to 1 TB for the operating system and applications, and I added a 1 TB SATA SSD for my data, since there is a expansion space for this additional drive, and the system provides an installation bracket and ribbon cable for that purpose.\\n\\nMy only disappointment is that the specifications indicate that the system will support a maximum of 20 GB of RAM, and states that there is 4 GB on onboard RAM, with the rest of the RAM installed in an expansion slot that is accessible for upgrading. My system came with 8 GB of RAM, but all of it was in the module in the expansion slot, and so when I replaced it with a 16 GB module, that is the maximum amount of memory I can use with the system. It's still a great system, and 16 GB is more than adequate for my purposes. It's just that the published specifications lead you to believe you can host more RAM than the system is capable of hosting.\",\n",

       " 'I have been in the professional IT industry for over 18 years and tinker with technology all the time for both work and fun. I am an enthusiast through-and-through who likes to explore the latest in the industry. For this particular review of the HP Chromebook 14 (2021), my extensive experience with Android, Apple iOS, and Windows phones and tablets will lend a helping hand in understanding what this laptop may or may not be suitable for.\\n\\nWHAT IS A CHROMEBOOK?\\nIt is important to first and foremost understand that Chromebook is precisely that — a laptop (notebook) based on Google’s Chrome operating system (OS), software that allows you to use and interact with the hardware. It offers a minimalistic, web browser experience that is far different from Windows and MacOS, but may appear familiar to Android users.\\n\\nThis particular HP Chromebook offers the Google Play Store from which you can download apps, games, and consume books, music, and movies — just like a Samsung smartphone or Google TV device. It also offers apps from the Google Chrome Web Store that are very limited in functionality but can enhance the web browsing experience with extensions (plugins).\\n\\nChrome OS is today’s dominant computing system used within the Education market, an area that Microsoft had been trying to challenge with its failed Windows RT and Windows S-Mode efforts. Apple, too, trails behind Google’s Chromebook platform.\\n\\nIN SHORT: Chrome OS, which was launched in 2011, very much feels like an Android tablet slapped onto a laptop form factor. It does not offer a full PC/Mac experience and essentially is a (usually) low-cost/low-powered computer whose main interface is the Google Chrome web browser.\\n\\nApps you download will constantly remind you that Chrome OS was not made for use as a full-fledged desktop computer (like Windows and MacOS) — they will be running in skewed, often frustrating, user interfaces that do not take advantage of the mouse and keyboard. If you have used the Apple iPad and downloaded iPhone apps onto it (with black bars on both sides of the screen), that is exactly how the Google apps behave on this Chromebook.\\n\\nThe fact that this HP Chromebook does NOT have a touch screen will magnify the frustration further when trying to use those apps, such as Facebook, Facebook Messenger, and more. There are some apps that do take full advantage of the entire screen: Plex, Netflix, Chrome browser, Word, Excel, etc. But again, many of their interfaces are designed for the touch experience and not for a keyboard/mouse combination.\\n\\nNow that you know some of the main differences in user and software experience between a Chromebook and Windows/MacOS laptop, let us discuss what IS good about the HP Chromebook 14 (2021).\\n\\nPROS\\n- Light weight (3.25 lbs)\\n-- 12.8″ L x 8.6″ W x 0.7″ H\\n- Great, all-day battery life\\n- Pleasant, clean, simple hardware design\\n-- Minimalistic and simple for basic computing\\n-- Inexpensive, though competing Windows laptops may offer slightly more for the same price point\\n- Excellent for day-to-day web browsing and occasional Android app use\\n-- Brain of the computer, the Intel Celeron N4000 processor, is well-suited for this use case and provides low power usage\\n- 14″ HD display, though its 1366 x 768 pixel resolution puts it in the 720p HD territory, not the sharper 1080p\\n- Multiple apps and browser tabs performed well, though the 4GB of memory (RAM) will limit how much you can have running at once without negatively affecting overall performance\\n- Built-in, wide angle webcam that was good, but not quite flattering or sharp\\n- Dual microphones captured audio well for video conferences\\n- Access to a full suite of Google Play Store apps, games, music, movies, and books\\n-- Microsoft Office supported, albeit as limited web or Android app versions\\n- Google Play Store games performed adequately well\\n-- Graphics powered by the integrated Intel UHD 600 chip\\n- Extremely low risk of a virus taking over (but apps and Google Chrome browser extensions can still steal your data and more)\\n-- Commonly used for Google Classroom and the education market because its functionality can be limited with supported, administrative Google controls\\n- 32 GB of eMMC storage built in\\n-- Though this is generous for casual computing, you may quickly find yourself running out of space and needing to augment it with a microSD card\\n-- eMMC storage is very slow compared to SSD drives\\n- Storage expansion via microSD card slot\\n-- Tested to work fine with a SanDisk 128GB card\\n--- SanDisk and Kingston are the top SD card makers I recommend for their reliability. SanDisk Extreme offers lifetime warranty and is the series I, personally, always get\\n-- You should always make a backup of your important files)\\n- Support for running a subset of Linux\\n- Rechargeable with USB-C PD\\n- 2 USB-C PD and 1 USB-A ports\\n- Bluetooth and WiFi\\n- Bang Olufsen-tuned speakers were loud enough to enjoy a movie with in a quiet room, but did not wow me much\\n\\nCONS\\n- Subpar screen that is dim at times and not visible from all angles\\n-- Does not compare to the much more expensive Microsoft Surface (or even the lower cost Surface Go) display\\n- Frustrating keyboard with some missing keys, like “Delete”, Caps Lock (there’s a keyboard shortcut to turn it on/off), and more\\n- Requires a constant connection to the internet for most tasks and apps\\n-- If you are offline, only a subset of apps can still be used\\n-- Not quite suitable for taking on the road unless you are able to somehow stay online to the Internet\\n- Limited storage space, making you more reliant on Cloud storage services like Google Cloud, Microsoft OneDrive, Dropbox, Box\\n- Does not have full functionality like a Windows/MacOS computer, including seamless file server access, user account controls, and more\\n-- Windows/MacOS can do everything this Chromebook can, plus usually faster and more\\n-- Microsoft Office is available only as limited web or Android app versions. To gain full functionality, you will still need Windows or MacOS\\n-- Full-featured programs not available for Chromebook, like Adobe Lightroom, Photoshop, Premiere video editing, etc.\\n- May be too minimalistic or simple\\n-- Limited support for hardware. Not all devices you connect to a Chromebook will work, even if they function fine with Windows/MacOS\\n- Does not interact well with Windows/MacOS computers like file sharing\\n- Screen is not touch sensitive, making use of some apps and games frustrating or impossible to enjoy\\n- Screen not detachable for use as a standalone tablet (like Microsoft’s Surface or Surface Book)\\n- Frustrating, limited, or non-existent user account controls, like Parental Controls, especially if your Google account was created with Google Apps/Suite/G Suite/Workspace, or whatever Google decides to rebrand its services to\\n- Memory and internal “hard drive” space are not upgradeable\\n- Tinny sound with little bass\\n- Slow with switching between users\\n- No wired network port (RJ-45 Ethernet) for when WiFi is not available\\n\\nTIPS\\n- Push the Search button to start the “Launcher” (the equivalent to Windows’ Start button)\\n- Push Ctrl–Alt–/ (all 3 keys) to see a list of all available keyboard shortcuts\\n-- Search Google for “chromebook keyboard shortcuts” to see more\\n- Push Search+L to lock the screen\\n-- You can go to Settings and type “Pin” to set up a pin code instead of having to always type in your Google account password\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\nFor someone who values the flexibility of running full-fledged software and could more easily connect to computer-accessible services, Windows-based low cost laptops are a better choice for a power user like myself. For someone who wants simplicity and mostly does everything from a web browser, consumes media through apps, and wants more of an Android and/or Linux experience, a Chromebook like this HP is a great option.\\n\\nNonetheless, either choice will be excellent for use as a travel laptop for blogging, researching, and so on — but in the case of a Chromebook, you will not be able to use it much if you do not have Internet access. We will be using our Chromebook primarily for casual web surfing, media consumption, writing reviews like this, and partially unsupervised school work.',\n",
       " \"I'm a Mac guy for the most part. My main computer is an iMac, but I've always had a Windows laptop for use when travelling etc (too cheap to buy a Macbook....). My Windows laptop died at a time when I really needed one and I saw this and thought what the heck, I'll give it a try.\\n\\nI'm very pleased. For online use, it's absolutely fine. The screen resolution isn't up to my Mac, but my Windows laptop wasn't either. I don't really like that I'm logged on to Google (and being tracked) whenever I use it, but I don't do anything online that I'd be ashamed of so I guess that's OK.\\n\\nIt was a little bit tricky to get online for the first time, but that's pretty well documented out on the web, and it was easy to get beyond the issue. Not really anything to worry about.\\n\\nThe battery life is very good. Haven't used the camera, so I don't know about that. But it's lightweight and portable and runs plenty fast. I think it's a very good value.\",\n",
       " \"I'm going to write this review assuming you already know the difference between a Chromebook and Windows or MacOS, but in case you don't know, it's basically a laptop that runs Google Chrome and Android Apps with a little bit of storage and the ability to work offline too.\\n\\nSo I'm going to focus more on hardware, features and performance.\\n\\nFirst off, the build is really nice. It is mostly plastic, and nice and light, but feels really solid and the hinge is not floppy at all. The base is a silver metallic color while the outer shell is bright white. It seems to resist fingerprints fairly well. You have a full size keyboard and a large trackpad, and the base has long rubber feet to keep it from sliding around your desk. On the left, there is a 3.5mm headphone jack, USB-C port, and micro-SD slot. On the right is another USB-C port as well as a USB-A (full size) port. The laptop charges via either USB-C port. Webcam and built in mic up top.\\n\\nPerformance wise, everything runs well enough. You won't be blown away by the speed or the screen quality/refresh rate or anything like that, but performance is solid and hiccups and stutters are relatively few. You can have multiple tabs and several apps running without bogging it down too much. The screen looks good and sharp for the size and resolution. Colors are not super vivid but look good. Battery life is fantastic. Easily 8-10+ hours between charges which blows a lot of Windows laptops out of the water.\\n\\nA few standouts for me are the nice feel of the keyboard and the excellent speakers. First, the keyboard just feels good to use. It's not too loud and the key travel is about perfect. The speakers are situated on either side of the keyboard facing up! Many laptops these days have the speakers underneath or just internal. So audio out of these is quite good compared to even more expensive devices. Also honorable mention goes to the fan-less design. In other words, it runs completely silently since there is no cooling fan or spinning disk drives.\\n\\nA few drawbacks as well... the keyboard is not lit, which is just fine considering this is a budget device, but worth noting. Also, while I really like the large clicky trackpad, the thumb side of my palms rest on it when typing and it doesn't take much force to click it, so I sometimes get random clicks when typing. Not a huge deal, but it'd be nice if it was slightly stiffer.\\n\\nAlso not really a drawback but more of an observation, it does not have a dedicated google assistant button down by Alt and Control.\\n\\nIf you have a Google account and an Android phone, there are a lot of benefits to syncing them up. However you can obviously still use it even if your an iPhone user, it just won't sync with your messages and notifications. Android users can also use their phones to instantly unlock it and activate tethering.\\n\\nSo to wrap up I believe this is a nice, budget friendly laptop and will do the job if you just need something to browse the web, do some productivity work in the Google suite (docs, slides, sheets, etc.), and play around with. It doesn't have all the bells and whistles but isn't missing anything essential. It runs good and the battery lasts a long time, so I am happy with it and think most people will find it's a nice device to have.\",\n",
       " \"Right off the bat this is an ok Laptop as-is. Its got a great power frugal processor with integrated Vega graphics. Its downsides are its anemic RAM (4gb) and Tiny Hard drive. Thankfully both of these can be upgraded on the cheap to make this a real beast of a PC. Im going to tell you step by step how I took this three hundred dollar pc and made it faster, with more memory and hard drive space under a 100 bucks, including the drive cloning tools!!!\\n\\n1. Purchase 4gb-16gb single DIM laptop memory - I purchased a varisys 16gb ddr4 module for $46.00 here on amazon.\\n2. Purchase larger NVME m.2 drive - I purchased a samsung pro 960 512gb for $42 from amazon.\\n3. Purchase 2 NVME usb adapters - Sold here on amazon for $8/each\\n4. Download paragron drive clone software.\\n\\nNow before I go any further I will say that the biggest bang for the buck is going to be the RAM upgrade in which it is the simplest and easiest upgrade for this system, you will get the same performance with the stock hard drive as you would the upgraded one just at a much smaller 128gb size. With the low cost of external drives you may not want to even upgrade the hard drive and just stick with external media to save larger files.\\n\\nAfter acquiring all your components the first thing you're going to want to do is disassemble the rear of the acer computer. There are 11 phillips head screws on the underside of the laptop, once those are removed use a plastic tool like a spudge or even a toothpick to gentle pry up one side of the rear case until it unclicks, from there slowly go around and lift up the rest of it, once youve gotten about a quarter way through you can simply just use your hand to free the rest of it. Once removed you will see an open DIMM slot for a memory module (thats where out 16gb stick is going) and below that the already installed m.2 128gb Hard drive. Remove the phillips head screw from the m.2 drive and remove the drive itself from the computer. At this point insert the drive into one of the USB caddys you purchased from amazon and than take your new drive and insert that one in a caddy as well. From there take both loaded hard drive caddys and put them in another windows PC you have. Once thats done ensure that the computer is recognizing both drives and than install paragon software. Once installed run paragon and choose drive clone. From there set your source drive as the original m.2 drive you removed from the acer computer and your destination drive as the newly purchased NVME drive. Choose Sector by sector copy and click next. This process will go pretty quickly and will probably only take around 5-10 minutes depending on the computer youre using to clone the drives on. Once the drive is cloned, take the new nvme drive and insert it into the Acer notebook where the old one was removed. From there pop in your new memory module into the empty memory slot above. Once one make sure things are seated well and the m.2 drive is screwed back down. Once thats done put the back case back on the computer and gently push down the backing until it clicks back into place. Once done reattatch the screws until all are reinstalled. Flip her over, and fire her up! Verify that everything works and go about your way. However I would suggest turning off windows S mode and using Home instead as you can install third party apps.\\n\\nNow onto my clickbait title. The computer in the picture next to the acer is my m1 macbook pro with 1tb drive and 16gb ram. Without taxes it was $1,700 bucks. I have photoshop, lightstudio, propresent all installed on it. All of which are large memory and processor dependent hogs. On my acer I have the exact same programs installed. And guess what the acer loads them quicker, renders files faster, runs cooler, and is about a quarter of the price. Battery life is about as good as my macbook, acer with movies or web browsing is around 7-8 hours of battery life. And no joke but I am now using this acer as my primary travel computer for work and design in lieu of my macbook. I like the larger screen, better keyboard layout and less worry about breaking it as its a quarter of the price. The acer itself build quality is that of 1k+ pc's and has a nice metal desgin with minimal plastic. Keyboard isnt mushy and is quite tactile for a laptop. Screen is ok, could be brighter, but still very good. Processor is a beast and will deal with anything thrown at it. Light gaming can also be done on this machine, however this isnt intended for AAA titles. All in all this is one of the more surprising purchases Ive made recently that really blew me away in terms of performance for so little investment. For a grand total of 387 (including laptop) I have a machine that rivals PC laptops costing well over a grand and macs costing nearly 2 grand!!!\",\n",

       " 'Wow, I am impressed by this laptop. It has the best keyboard feel, display quality, and high-end look at this price point. This is a good choice IF you are ok with the small data storage space (or plan to upgrade).\\n\\n— The lighted keyboard feels like a keyboard from a premium $1,000 - $2,000 laptop. Very nice soft touch with excellent quiet tactile feedback.\\n\\n— I love the power switch button location as a key on the upper right of the keyboard. It is so much easier to find this key vs. fumbling around trying to find a power button on the side of the case.\\n\\n— The image quality on the display is excellent. This has a matte finish, not the super glossy finish which creates glare. I like the matte screen for all room lighting conditions and color accuracy. I am really impressed with the screen because at this low price I usually see terrible laptop screen resolution and quality. This one is an exception with the very nice Full HD IPS display.\\n\\n— This has the key extras, such as a webcam, fingerprint reader, and combination of USB 3 + C port types.\\n\\n— This comes with Windows S mode (limited apps for security) and it takes just a few seconds to click on the Microsoft Store and change Windows to regular mode.\\n\\n— There is minimal bloatware (unnecessary software preinstalled) which is nice, because that’s a common annoyance on new computers. I didn’t have to uninstall anything to get a clean, streamlined Windows 10.\\n\\nI recommend this laptop for two types of users:\\n\\n1. If you need something for basic web browsing, school or office work and you are ok with the tiny drive data storage capacity.\\n\\n2. If you are the kind of techie who likes to use your own memory + disk drive upgrade rather than the manufacturer provided components.

       " \"Just received my prime day special. It is an attractive looking package but the fan runs a lot of the time and sounds like a jet engine. I'm used to my old Aspire E 15 which was quiet as a mouse. I really wanted to upgrade to quad core as well as get turbo speed out of the processor but the AMD software doesn't work on laptops apparently. So I'm stuck looking around for a way to speed the processor up from its average 1.7ghz speed. If my grandson hadn't broken the bezel on the old laptop I would have kept it as it was working perfectly. At least he his getting a great laptop.\",\n",
       " 'The first thing I want to say is this laptop is not a good value; the asking price is too high for what the product has to offer. This doesn\\'t mean it\\'s a bad laptop, rather, for the money, there are better options out there. The listing also has misinformation in it, notably it mentions an \"HD touch screen\" but this laptop does not have a touch screen. It also says it comes with Windows 10 Home, which is technically true, but it comes with S mode enabled. S mode does offer a value if this is going to be handed to a child who could be prone to getting viruses because this mode restricts executables (Apps) from running other than the Windows store. The good news is you can disable this, but it requires logging in with a microsoft account to do so. You also cannot revert back to S mode. To make this change, open Settings and go to Activation, then click the Go to the store option.\\n\\nGiven that this laptop is a budget laptop, and is probably aimed at non-tech savvy users who just want a machine to do work or school on (with optional light gaming), the review won\\'t be too technical and I\\'ll try to explain things in a manner that anyone can understand without spitting out a bunch of numbers or tech terms.\\n\\nDISPLAY: Starting with the display itself, it\\'s not very good. The viewing angles are bad, meaning when you look at it off angle as opposed to directly on, the picture starts to wash out and becomes more difficult to see. The resolution of the display is also only a baffling 1366x768, which falls short of the 1080p standard most displays are designed around. This means some websites will not scale properly on the display, as well as the picture not being as crisp as as 1080p screen would offer. The good news is the bezels, or the edging around the screen itself, is thin which looks nice and shows more of the screen.\\n\\nKEYBOARD: The keyboard is just okay to type on. You shouldn\\'t have any problems writing school essays or work reports on this: the key travel (the distance the keys push down before they register the input--which helps people who type \"feel\" when the input is activated to facilitate typing) is fair but if you want to write a novel I suggest another laptop with a more mechanical feel. Also, notably, there is no backlight (when the keys light up so you can see the keyboard in the dark) which is a big disappointment.\\n\\nPORTS: The available ports are: (Right side = SD storage, aux port for wired headphones) // (Left side = HDMI out (so you can connect the laptop to another monitor or TV that has HDMI in which will then display your laptop screen on that monitor or TV), one USB 3.0 , and two USB 2.0. The difference between 3.0 and 2.0 is the transfer speeds. If you stick in a flash drive, make sure you use the 3.0 slot. You can tell which one is 3.0 by looking at the image I put in this review.\\n\\nCPU: The processor included in this laptop is a bit worse than the latest comparable Intel option, the i3 10th gen mobile, but it\\'s also less expensive. This again goes into why I think this laptop doesn\\'t have a great value, because to me it\\'s worth $300 at most, but they\\'re asking for over $400 for it. When you look at laptops in the $380 range, you\\'re getting an intel i3 10th gen with a 1080p screen, and in some cases, more RAM and memory. However, that doesn\\'t mean it\\'s a bad processor. It\\'s quite good for what it is, actually. If the most you want to get out of this is to watch 1080p videos (even though the resolution of this laptop doesn\\'t go up to 1080p), the processor is more than capable of handling that.\\n\\nMEMORY: There is 4GB of RAM soldered to the motherboard, which is really the bare minimum a windows 10 laptop should have. Given that it\\'s soldered, you aren\\'t able to swap it out with something else, but the good news is there is an open slot on the motherboard to add your own RAM. If you want to go this route, which I suggest you do, here\\'s what you want to buy: you can go up to 8GB (for a total of 12--though I recommend just an additional 4GB stick for normal usage) of DDR4-2400Mhz 1.2v. If you\\'re looking at a listing of \"laptop RAM\" make sure it falls within those specifications. Getting to the memory banks is easy, even if you aren\\'t tech savvy I\\'ll easily explain how to do it safely: 1) turn the laptop completely off. 2) use a small screwdriver to remove all the screw underneath the laptop (be sure not to lose them). 3) near the hinges, lift your fingers up and slowly and carefully pry the back of the case off. I was very careful and still broke some tabs because it\\'s very cheaply made, but don\\'t worry if you do--the tabs don\\'t do a whole lot anyway. 4) once the back is off, add the RAM into the slot, and put the case back on and put the screws back in. Lastly, just make sure the case is sealed all around the edges by pinching them until it clicks back into place.\\n\\nSTORAGE: The 128GB SSD included is in NVME form, which just means if you want to replace the storage (can\\'t add onto it since there\\'s only one slot for stoage), you can do so with a bigger NVME drive. To replace this, look at the above steps for replacing the RAM and also follow the software transfer guide incluided in the NVME package for moving the operating system and your files over to the new drive.\\n\\nTOUCHPAD: The touchpad is pretty good. It\\'s fairly responsive and responds well to multi gesture touches, such as using two fingers to scroll up and down on webpages.\\n\\nWEBCAM: The webcam is horrendous. It will suffice at the bare minimum but the resolution is 480p at 30fps. If you don\\'t know what that means, just understand it\\'s well below average. Thankfully, there\\'s a privacy shutter which blocks the webcam so certain malicious ads and attackers can\\'t open your camera to see you while you are using the laptop.\\n\\nWEIGHT: The laptop itself is also too heavy for what it is. It\\'s almost 5lbs. Other companies are able to shave almost a pound off of a similarly-sized laptop.\\n\\nCHASIS: The chasis of the laptop is made out of plastic through-and-through. It flexes incredibly easy, meaning if you press down on it with a bit of force, the plastic will bend. The panel is also easy to flex, but this is to be expected on a laptop in this price point.\\n\\nGAMING: This laptop is capable of doing light gaming. I didn\\'t go too in depth with testing, but I did install minecraft and low visual settings, the game was running at a consistent 55fps for the most part, the lowest being a short dip of 18fps when it was loading a lot of things at once. There\\'s only one heat pipe on the motherboard, so it\\'s not really designed around cooling. The laptop will get pretty warm if you start to use it for heavy tasks, such as light gaming.\\n\\nBATTERY LIFE: The battery is decent. It could have been bigger, especially since there\\'s plenty of real estate in the laptop to allow it, but it was is a cost-cutting decision. However, during my testing, when I ran this laptop at 80% brightness and using \"Better performance\" in Windows 10 for the power output, I was able to get around 6 hours of YouTube watching from 100% until it forced itself in sleep mode to prevent it from shutting down completely.\\n\\nSPEAKERS: The speakers are surprisingly decent. You won\\'t be forced to use headphones with this. Other laptops that I\\'ve reviewed that are more expensive than this one had worse speakers, so this is a plus.\\n\\nIf you do decide to get this laptop, here are some things you should know:\\n+Setup is easy out of the box, but don\\'t connect it to the internet until you get to the desktop otherwise it will force you to create a microsoft account. If you want to do that, go for it, but I\\'d avoid it. However, if you want to disable S mode, you\\'ll need one anyway so weigh your options here.\\n\\n+It doesn\\'t have bloatware at all, meaning you don\\'t need to comb through the laptop to remove a bunch of unnecessary crap. In fact, the installed applications were one drive, some lenovo app, and office 365. I uninstalled 365 because I don\\'t need it, but keep it if you do, I think they give you a free trial.\\n\\n+When you get to the desktop, click the start menu and type Update, click \"Check for updates\". Click \"Advanced Options\" and enable the first option which says to Receive updates for other MS products when you update windows\". Click the back arrow then click Check for updates and keep installing updates until there aren\\'t any left to install.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the asking price of this laptop is too high for what you\\'re getting in return. There are other options that are cheaper or comparable that will get you more memory, a better CPU, and a better screen, but looking at this laptop in a vacuum, it\\'s not bad for what it is.',\n",

You can use a wireless mouse which is seen in one of my photos. The sound quality is a little meh, but not an issue if you hook up some speakers to it. The microphone works really well and paired with an actual headphone/microphone set the sound quality is crystal clear. Took a little bit of tweaking to get the screen brightness to actually look more \"crisp\" as you have to go into the system and change it yourself, not just simply adjusting the brightness. Easy to carry and feels a littl bulky but I prefer that so it doesn\\'t feel like it could snap at any moment, easy to fit in a backpack.

       " \"I really liked this little machine and for the price, in my opinion is a steal. It is like 20% faster than my mini PC which sports an Intel Celeron N3450 Quad-core. Per my tests with the 64GB eMMC included, even Windows 10 (v2004) is snappy. I also ran Linux on it with no issues, except that the wireless driver needs to be installed manually(tested on Mx Linux for instance). The sequential reading for the Sandisk eMMC is 316 MB/s and 154 MB/s writing.\\n\\nOnce I booted up on the Windows installed, switched from Windows 10 in S Mode to Windows 10 Home for free in the Microsoft App Store and went ahead and activated the Office 365 subscription included for free(1 year). After that, I cleaned up the disk and installed everything from scratch. The drivers can be downloaded from the official Asus homepage. I had zero issues with Windows 10 20H1(v2004) but when tested version 20H2 (v2009), I had issues with the WIFI connection, so left 20H1.\\n\\nSomething interesting on this machine is that there's an empty slot for adding our own SSD NVME M.2. I didn't' test it myself as I didn't have a spare SSD, but there are a few videos where someone could put in a 1TB SSD.\\n\\nThe BIOS version included was v302, so one of the first things I did was to update to the latest version v306.\\n\\nI wish it had a backlit keyboard and an IPS screen. That would made it perfect for my needs. It's also very well built to be a cheap laptop.\\n\\nOverall, I would buy it again.\\n\\n[UPDATE 2-3-2021]\\n\\nI installed a 512GB SSD and it worked like a charm. The reading/writing speeds are around 1700/1200 MB/s respectively. I just added a screenshot.\\n\\nI did a triple boot (Windows 10, MX Linux and Chrome OS) using Refind and all is working fine.\\n\\nEDIT:\\n\\nI replaced the wireless card with an Intel Wifi6 AX200(Amazon B07SH6GV5S). This new card does not required me to install drivers at all on Windows 10(although intel recommends to install the latest driver version they provide and I did that), Linux (Kernel 5.8) or Chrome OS, which it's a plus for me. Also, tested on Windows 10 20H2 and found zero issues. Really happy with it. I almost forgot to say that this AX200 card also support Monitor Mode.\",\n",
       " \"I'm giving this little engine that could five stars. Why? Well, it's two hundred dollars. So I'm reviewing it as a two hundred dollar product. If I was comparing it to a Macbook Air M1, it would probably be three stars. If I was comparing it to a Microsoft Surface, three and a half. But it's a small, budget laptop, and in that category, it's excellent.\\n\\nQUICK RUNDOWN - It blows my mind how good of a job they did with this. I've used a lot of computers, and this one impresses me. If you've ever had a Chromebook, or even just a cheap (or perhaps even more expensive) laptop you'll feel the difference immediately. It has a few issues, none of which are deal breakers, but it has many, many pros. Read on.\\n\\nPROS --\\nIncredible Price to Performance Ratio\\nVery well built, with no cheap parts\\nFull-size, comfortable keyboard\\nSmall and lightweight\\nGood design (add stickers if it's a little too plain for you)\\nFull Windows 10 License, and no hardwired bloatware\\nInternal NVMe slot and external SD Card slot\\nI could keep going... it's $200.\\n\\nCONS --\\nNo backlight keyboard (at least on the 11.6 model)\\nSome irksome viewing angle problems\\nMaddeningly little built in storage\\nAlmost too little RAM\\n\\nI've divided the review into individual sections: webcam, speakers, performance, software, etc, so scroll down to the one that's most important to you, or read the review from top to bottom. They are (in order):\\n\\nIntroduction (above)\\nWeight & Build\\nKeyboard and Trackpad\\nScreen\\nBattery\\nPerformance (including Gaming)\\nWebcam\\nSpeakers & Sound\\nSoftware\\nOther (SD Card Slot, NVMe slot, HDMI output, heating, cleaning)\\nConclusion\\nLinks to Accessories\\n\\nLet me start with a few disclaimers. First, I've only been using it for a few weeks, which is about enough time to get a good sense of its mettle and iron out any problems it has. There's been a few things I've noticed that I've added to this review, (see 'performance' and 'screen') and I'll add more if more arise. No problem has been significant enough that it made me in any way wonder if it was worth. $200 is a really good price point.\\n\\nThe second disclaimer, is there's a few reviewers saying either A, they got a dud, or B, it clunked out on them after two years. Duds happen, with any product, this is no exception. So if mine does decided to go on the fritz, I'll update my review relative to the exchange process - I WON'T deduct stars *just* because it gave out. Second, if you get two years of solid use out of this, it's a good product. Just buy another one.\\n\\nWith that being said, let me get into the details.\\n\\nWEIGHT AND BUILD - This is one of its greatest strengths, and rivals many laptops in higher price ranges. There's no creaks, no cheap plastic waiting to shatter, it's not a flimsy toy. It's a solid electronic. It feels right, in your hands, on your lap, on a desk. So many laptops try and woo you with larger screens or better specs [or, for the life of me, a lower price tag], and turn out to be cup coasters you have to plug in. Not this. It really feels like it has some life in it.\\n\\nIt's not obscenely light, like a MacBook Air, but you can move about and use it on your lap without strain. If traveling's your kind of thing, then the weight is sufficient. I would feel comfortable carrying it through an airport.\\n\\nThe screen hinge feels durable and like it won't be breaking anytime soon, and when you set it at the position you like, it stays. The laptop isn't super-ultra-mega thin, but it is thin, and that's a nice bonus. You could probably fit it in an envelope, just maybe a slightly larger envelope then the one Steve Jobs used.\\n\\nKEYBOARD AND TRACKPAD - The keyboard, I'm in love with. It's full size; no cramping on tiny keys or accidentally presses. The give is decisive and gratifying, and it just feels good to use. The keyboard is actually the one (literally, the only one) thing I feel they cut a little too close to the corner on. There's no backlight. It appears as those some of the models have a backlight, though I'm not sure, but mine doesn't. (I got the 11.6 model). This can be a little frustrating, and I'm considering getting a book light so I can type in the dark. Again, this is a two hundred dollar laptop, so it is what it is. I'll make due.\\n\\nAnother note, is they put the 'delete' key right next to the power key. Shucks. A few times, I've gone to press the delete key, and the computer goes into sleep mode. This is more of an inconvenience than anything. Just press the power button again and it will start right back up where you left off. Still, if you're doing sensitive work, it's something to consider, and I'm sure you'll learn very quickly to be cautious.\\n\\nAlso, the 'enter' key is green. I thought this was strange, but I really like it. Hard to explain.\\n\\nThe trackpad is responsive and that click is also decisive and gratifying. I don't have any issues accidentally pressing it while I'm typing, and it's very good at doing what I expect it to. If I click or tap, the mouse clicks. If I click on the right, it right clicks. Scrolling is painless and intuitive and very nuanced. The numpad on the keyboard is a nice touch, though I would have traded it for a backlit keyboard.\\n\\nSCREEN - Going back to where we started, this is a two hundred dollar laptop. You're not getting an Apple Retina display. It has some minor viewing angle problems you'll have to accommodate for. If you're looking directly at it, everything looks good - pure colors, no whitening. If you turn it horizontally or bend the screen back, there's a noticeable change in tone. It is what it is, and it likely won't interfere with your work. Just don't do color grading for professional photoshoots on it.\\n\\nThe screen resolution is just right. The screen is small, but there's enough room to do what you want and then some. This is one of the most significant factors in comfort. If it were cramped, it would give you a headache and strain your eyes. But they did a good job of making sure there's some breathing room with a healthy buffer zone around whatever it is you're focusing on. You feel like you can move and engage in multiple things.\\n\\nThere's a few reviews complaining it's not a touch screen. You can't please everyone. It's not something I feel is missing, especially for $200.\\n\\nUPDATE: There's seems to be an issue with the screen calibration. Frequently, it will turn noticeably yellow, and by right clicking on the desktop and clicking 'display settings,' it seems to at least temporarily fix it. I believe very much this is a software issue, so it's unlikely you'll encounter it, but it would be interesting to know if others are encountering the same problem.\\n\\nBATTERY - The battery life is on point. The time remaining Windows estimates seems to vary quite a bit, but I watched two movies and used it for 4 hours, and still had 17%. It's the kind of thing you can charge at night and it will last you the day under normal conditions. It also doesn't have quick charge, another little cut corner, but I'm not stressing about it. Then again, I'm around a power outlet most of the time. If quick charge is an issue for you, you're in the wrong price point.\\n\\nSide note: the charging port really plugs in. You have to give it a little oomph to pull it out. Which can be a pro and a con. You definitely don't want to trip on the cord; the whole thing will go flying off the table. But you can reposition the device without having to worry about the cord falling out.\\n\\nPERFORMANCE - This is actually one of its biggest strengths, and really surprised me. All the components come together to create a seamless experience. I was nervous about the odd named Intel Processor (N6 something something) but it turns out, it's actually an Intel Celeron. And only four gigs of memory? Doesn't seem like quite enough. But it somehow manages to muscle out the minimum, and have some left over. My guess is, this is largely due to the SSD. Just a few years ago, laptop manufacturers had two options for storage: a physical hard drive, which was expensive, bulky, and a power drain, or some sort of memory like a thumb drive. Both were slow and huge bottle necks.\\n\\nWell, this thing has a Solid State Drive. And that makes all the difference. With a decent processor, just enough memory, and the SSD, it will breeze through any routine task you ask it to do: open Microsoft Word, surf the web, torrent files, play music, and it will do it all without a hitch. Performance, under reasonable conditions, should never be a problem: you'll never feel a pause or get frustrated.\\n\\nI LOVE the original Warhammer: 40K: Dawn of War series. This plays it effortlessly, even with mods. Which is very welcomed. I can imagine it can also play Sins of a Solar Empire, Age of Empires, Among Us, Terraria, and maybe even Minecraft, if that's your kind of thing. Check out GOG.com (great old games) and you'll be surprised at what's out there. If you are planning to do some light gaming, the NVMe slot will really come in handy.\\n\\nIMPORTANT EDIT: After using it for some weeks, the lack of RAM is starting to become an issue. Windows has done a good job managing memory, but even day-to-day tasks can overwhelm it. This expresses itself as stalled applications, dropped Chrome tabs, or even system notifications that the system has run out of Memory. It did reach a significant error, though - everything went black, and after a reboot, Windows wanted to help set up my system (which is a big error.) Luckily everything was intact, my files, settings and programs. So it's just kind of a startling headache.\\n\\nI was running a few programs, nothing too demanding. So if you're planning on using this for anything more then Spotify and Chrome, be forewarned.\\n\\nWEBCAM - The webcam is about what you would expect. It's a hefty 0.3 megapixels, but there aren't any dropped frames, and the color processing is alright. If you need a webcam on the fly, it'll due. If you use a webcam for any serious purposes, I would suggest investing in a nice one, which you were probably going to do anyway. The device will be able to handle it without issue.\\n\\nOf special note, is the microphone, which is actually great. Audio comes through clear and audible, distinct and focused. If you do find yourself in a situation where you have to use the onboard webcam, the video quality won't be great, but you won't have any problem being heard and understood.\\n\\nSPEAKERS & SOUND - The speakers are placed under the device, pointing directly down. You would think this would make them impossible to hear, but it projects and doesn't distort the sound. I've watched a few movies, and haven't had an issue hearing them - it gets plenty loud. I'm a bit of an audiophile, (though there are many more advance then I), and what I can say about these speakers is they're passable. They're not so bad that you're getting irked with the sound quality, but they're not so good you would enjoy Beethoven's 5th. The various aspects of sound - the bass, and whatever else the other parts are called, are balanced and clear.\\n\\nIf you're using it for casual media use, the lackluster sound quality will fade into the background and you'll be able to enjoy whatever it is you're doing.\\n\\nThe headphone amplifier is decent and it appears they didn't skimp on it. I tested it with a pair of Sony MDR7506s (which are one-for-one studio monitors with a higher than average impedance.) The amplifier didn't quit reach optimal levels, but it produced clear and pleasing sound. (and it does have a nice kick to it.) For an onboard amplifier, it's more then adequate. If you're a real audiophile and use an external amplifier, the primary factor to consider is if the sound it's putting out can be boosted, and it definitely can.\\n\\nSOFTWARE - There's a few pieces of bloatware you'll want to uninstall. McAfee, Skype, MyAsus. (if you don't know what bloatware is, ask the techy in your family to remove it for you.) Fortunately, none of them are hard coded into the software or hardware, so uninstalling them is straight forward and simple and can be done through 'Add or Remove Programs.' The laptop does come in Windows S mode (which is suppose to be a simpler version of Windows, but has some bothersome limitations for power users.) They made it extremely easy to convert into regular Windows 10. I clicked a button once and haven't had to worry about it since: full Windows 10.\\n\\nOTHER - What I find really helpful is the SD Card Slot. The 64 gigs of storage it comes with goes REALLY quick. I like to watch, uh, documentaries in public domain (like 'Joker' with Joaquin Phoenix). It's amazingly simple to plug in an SD card (I got a 256gb one for $45), set up uTorrent to load all the unfinished and finished torrents onto the card, and that solves the whole problem. Just about any SD card you buy will be fast enough to download movies and play one at the same time.\\n\\nOther reviewers have pointed out it comes with a slot for an NVMe SSD. If you don't know what that is, it probably doesn't make much of a difference. If you do, it's a very helpful addition. Hooray.\\n\\nIt has tons of ports, which is great. Two USB ports, a USB-C port, the above mentioned SD card slot, an auxiliary port, and an HDMI port. I've used the HDMI port on a full screen TV, and it works for watching a movie. The quality of the movie file will make a difference - but the sound compression changes that are necessary with downloaded media [generally done through VLC] help a lot. It's not blu-ray, but performance doesn't seem to be affected by what's happening in a scene or the amount of sound.\\n\\nIf you're planning on using this for presentations, it's exactly what you want. Plug, play 'n forget.\\n\\nDuring normal, unplugged, use you wouldn't be able to tell that it's turned on just by the heat. If you're running a process-intensive program or have it plugged in, it does heat up, but that's normal. You can use it on your lap without a worrying. I don't see heating being an issue. It's also fanless, which is a big deal if you live in a dusty environment. You won't slowly be running it into the ground just by using it, listening to the fan whir louder and louder as it tries to compensate for all the dust.\\n\\nSide note: If it overheats, it'll just turn off. It won't hurt it.\\n\\nI like to take good care of my computers, so ease of cleaning matters to me. Being fanless, that alleviates a lot of of the issues you would come across. Still, you can't access behind the keyboard, so it will be interesting to see how that plays out. You might be able to remove each key and clean it out, which would go a long way, but I wouldn't try it without doing some research and carefully weighing the benefits and risks.\\n\\nEither way, do yourself a favor: buy a small pack of Q-tips, a little bottle of house hold cleaner (Pinesol works well), and lens clothes, and throw them in the bag or case you're carrying the laptop in. Occasionally go over the keyboard with the Q-tips and wipe down the exterior, and the lens cloth will come in handy a lot more then you think. I don't know if it will necessarily add to the life of the machine, but it will feel a lot better. And it's worth taking some pride in your devices.\\n\\nCONCLUSION - The bottom line is, is it feels good to use. Everything from the keyboard to the performance to the build quality makes it a very enjoyable and complete experience: there's nothing really lacking that will get in your way. It's spectacular for day-to-day use, and it's got a little muscle to it. For $200, you're getting a real product, and it even has something to say to higher end laptops. If you decide to go with this, I think you'll be very pleased.\\n\\nLINK TO ACCESSORIES - Some may find this helpful. These are subject to change - Amazon is always adding or removing their product offerings, so if one's not available, these should at least give you an idea of what to look for. But at the time of this writing, these are the accessories I purchased for it, and that all work.\\n\\nSD Card (256gb, $40) - Lots of storage to hold a small collection of movies, music, or pictures.

However, they reinstalled Windows 10, which deleted my one year free trial of Microsoft Office. I contacted them about this and they said that I would just have to download the one month free trial or purchase it for $69.99. I specifically purchased this laptop for the one year free trial and HP refuses to fix the problem that is THEIR fault.

       " 'HP has a number of different lines of laptops, and plain \"HP\" is the budget line (there\\'s also the EliteBook, Spectre, ZBook, and so on.) At first glance, the chassis looks very similar to the EliteBooks, but once you touch it, you get that all-plastic feel that says \"cheap\".\\n\\nThere are a couple of specifications that, at the time of this writing, do not match the model. This is listed as having a fingerprint sensor, but it doesn\\'t. It also doesn\\'t have a backlit keyboard.\\n\\nThe computer itself is quite light for a 17\", owing much to the plastic chassis. The display is... well, not very good. It\\'s very dim relative to most 17\" displays, the viewing angle isn\\'t great, and despite having a matte finish, light sources reflect off of it easily. This is definitely a display for content consumption rather than content creation.\\n\\nThe i5 processor is sufficient enough for basic use. I probably wouldn\\'t want to render things with this computer, but you don\\'t have to worry about running Office, some browser tabs, and something like Spotify at the same time. Cooling on the CPU is passable, at best. With the fan pushing at max speed, the bottom can still get a bit toasty. I\\'m not sure how HP has tuned their thermal management system, but it seems to me that they\\'re going for silence over performance.\\n\\nThe included 8 GB is a bit sparse, though. The spec sheet on this model shows that it has 2x4 GB SO-DIMMs, and I was happy to see that there were just four normal Phillips screws on the bottom. However, this would lead to disappointment when I tried to verify that the RAM wasn\\'t soldered on. HP doesn\\'t want you poking around the guts of this computer. When I removed the screws, I expected the keyboard to drop -- as this is a upper-into-lower configuration where they top of the system chassis and keyboard are a single integrated piece into a bowl-type lower chassis. It didn\\'t drop, though. Even with proper fancypants wedge tools, all the plastic wanted to do was flex. Fearing a cracked case, I gave up. HP is usually pretty good about publishing service manuals, but as of this writing, they don\\'t have one up for the 17-cn0021nr.\\n\\nAs for other aspects, they\\'re pretty good. The keyboard is more solid than I was expecting -- not really far off from my EliteBook in terms of feel and key travel. Though I did miss the backlighting on the black-on-silver keycaps. Other than in bright light, they can be difficult to read. And while I prefer keyboards without numpads, the positioning and offset trackpad made this comfortable to type with.\\n\\nThe included AC adapter is on the small side for a 17\" laptop, though I\\'m disappointed that HP went with their proprietary pin adapter instead of a USB-C solution. Of note though: the adapter from my 2020 EliteBook 15 worked fine, despite being overpowered.\\n\\nAs much as I\\'d like to recommend this, the one thing that probably differentiates this laptop in the price range is the big 17\" display -- and it just isn\\'t that great. I\\'d probably sacrifice the 2\" of real estate and get something with a better display for a similar cost.',\n",
       " 'If you can get past the bloatware (easy enough with a reformat) that comes pre-installed, this is actually a decent laptop. It boots up fast after the initial setup, the i5 processor is plenty capable for all but the most demanding tasks, and the 8GB RAM is sufficient for daily use. But there\\'s a big problem that IS tough to look (literally) past...\\n\\nThe screen on this laptop is absolutely atrocious. The resolution is about the equivalent of 720p - on a new laptop - in 2021.... Um, what? As if that weren\\'t bad enough, the colors are completely washed out from the tremendous backlight bleeds - and not even just along the edges or in the corners - the whole screen has a white glow to it! It really is a shame because as I stated above, the specs on this are pretty good and it\\'s very capable, but that doesn\\'t help if you can\\'t comfortably look at what you\\'re doing.\\n\\nThe build quality is about what you should expect at this price point (which I don\\'t fully know because it\\'s \"unavailable\" at the time of review). It\\'s very much all plastic, but doesn\\'t feel overly-cheap. I didn\\'t like the trackpad though - even when tapping (instead of clicking) it still moves enough to make a \"click\" sound. But it works well-enough. The stated specs in the description are inaccurate - they say it has 1x8GB RAM sticks in it, yet the computer reports 2x4GB. This is better for performance but adds expense to an upgrade to 16GB. I did not open the laptop to verify whether or not the SSD or RAM is easily upgradeable for fear of breaking some of the plastic bits. Also, I would\\'ve appreciated a built-in Ethernet port. I know WiFi is good enough for most people, but it\\'s still nice to have the option. A card reader would\\'ve been nice too, but I know I\\'m starting to add a lot of wants to a very cheap machine.\\n\\nSo overall, I am disappointed in this laptop and don\\'t recommend it. There are far better choices for the money. if you absolutely NEED a 17-inch at this price point then this one will perform okay. But just be prepared for its huge shortcoming with the screen they chose to put in here. They should\\'ve subsidized one more piece of bloatware to get a better LCD panel.',\n",

She likes that this laptop is upgradable and operates flawlessly. We followed the recommendations of others and did not connect to WiFi while initially setting up this laptop. If you do, setup will take much longer as it needs to download Windows updates. It’s much better to let it update when you are not planning on using it such as late in the evening. It has a really nice feel to the keys and and they seems to be very good quality. We never purchased this brand before, but we thought we would give it a try as it was in the price range we were looking for. All I can say is this if the wife is happy, then all is good!!!

Taking a look at the online reviews shows that the screen isn't the best, and it takes a few more hits, but even so it looks like an amazing deal. After using it, in my opinion it's worth the money, but not as fantastic as it appears.\\n\\nTLDR: Look at what you want in a laptop before buying this one. For me it works fine but there are a few key drawbacks that might affect different tasks you would want to use this laptop for.\\n\\nThe PRO's\\n+ Build Quality is fantastic, with sturdy metal and a keyboard I surprisingly quite enjoy using.\\n+ Big PRO: The Ryzen 4700U processor is a beast, and the snappiest processor I've used. Productivity use such as coding, taking notes in class, running other professional programs like the Microsoft suite or Zoom are handled easily and perfectly.\\n+ Big PRO: A 512GB SSD for this price is incredible! And it's even a really good SSD at that.\\n\\nThe CON's\\n- The screen is as bad as they say, even after calibration. It's only slightly better than my old laptop I bought for $350 a few years ago. However, as someone who doesn't use the laptop for video editing, it's not a big issue for me, but everything does look more green/blue than it should.\\n- I've had software problems with this laptop that I would not have expected from a pre-built laptop, especially from a company like Acer. I have problems with apps being fuzzy (not scaling to the display properly), problems with Cortana and the Windows Start menu, and problems with the screen not immediately waking from sleep. These problems are rare and/or not too impactful, but still annoying.\\n- The BIGGEST CON by far is the thermals. The laptop has amazing specs as I mentioned above, but it can't use them to their full potential because the components get too hot and have to cut back on speed. The fans are noisy and run at full speed often. I regularly experience temps of 70°+ while web browsing, and 90°+ while (light) gaming or other more intensive tasks.\\nTo me that is a huge letdown, as this laptop does not perform heavy tasks like it should. The processor is limited by the cooling of the laptop and can't really do all that it's has the potential to do.\\n\\nOverall, I am disappointed by the low upper limit of the hardware, but for my needs as a tech-savvy college student looking for a good laptop for classes, it's perfect. It's light and portable, sturdy, fast, and cheap. Even the gaming/heavy use cases are.... acceptable, even if they aren't what they could be. I recommend this laptop to many people, but it's not for everyone.\",\n",
       " \"I try really hard not to do same-day delivery reviews, no matter how great I think the product is because you can never tell on that first day what might go wrong later. However, I am actually confident and happy enough with this one to go for it. If I make amendments later, they won't likely be anything that changes this rating. (updated 6/19/20 - one week, using it for work in web design and content creation, still love it)\\n\\nI needed a business-appropriate laptop. My requirements for this were pretty simple: something with a sharp but conservative appearance, MOBILE (not heavy or bulky), but also just as powerful (or capable of being just as powerful) as my much larger personal laptop. It came down to this and the Lenovo Flex. I chose this because the design was all metal, and I liked Macbook Airs when working as an Apple systems manager for their durability, style, and mobility. It's just a shame the RAM is not upgradeable (it's soldered). The RAM on the Lenovo Flex is not upgradeable either, though. It also comes with a weaker processor (Ryzen 5, which isn't quite on the i7's level). I doubt anyone will need more than 8 to 16GB of RAM in the lifetimes of these laptops. I knew that if I got a Ryzen 5 that would just make me want the Ryzen 7 processor more (you can never upgrade processors in a laptop). So, despite toting less RAM, Swift still came out as the winner both in design and performance when I compared it up close to the Flex online.\\n\\nI worried a bit when I read a review that complained about the screen and graphics on Swift being almost unusable. But I clearly had nothing to worry about. Those professional reviewers sometimes can get so snobby with hardware, they set the bar higher than anyone in the real world would ever set it.\\n\\nThe screen is semi-matte. I have very sensitive eyes, sensitive enough that I often have to wear blue light blocking glasses to deal with sunlight, bright indoor lights, or computer light. Even the slightest flicker is noticeable to me in a very uncomfortable, painful kind of way that strains my eyes. There's the tiniest amount of flicker in this display. It is NOTHING like the reviews have been describing, which made me afraid I wouldn't be able to use this laptop. It's VERY easy on my eyes after switching the AMD Radeon settings to Enhanced and High Res (which simultaneously smoothes and sharpens up the text, making it more legible). It also does NOT have a glossy, highly reflective screen. The screen is semi-matte at the worst (honestly, it's not even that much), and it's full matte once it's turned on. Evidently Acer has switched displays after the complaints (they tend to be good about doing things like that). It gets super bright, and the colors are close to true as far as I can tell - only publishing something is going to reveal the truth there, which I haven't done yet. But again, I can't believe what a close call it is to a Macbook Air.\\n\\nThe graphics performance: It's not a gaming laptop, though I'm sure it is good enough to play most games on medium and would be PERFECT for a student. It's definitely strong enough to perform smoothly for graphic artists, photographers, and anyone that tends to keep a ton of tabs open in their browser. Smooth scrolling and rendering, no lag or glitching.\\n\\nI cannot compliment the Ryzen 7 processor enough. I am moving from an 8th gen i7 and the Ryzen 7 is WAY more responsive and less prone to freezing or errors. I can very easily believe it maxes out at 4ghz. Those eight cores handle multitasking like a true champ.\\n\\nI was worried the RAM would give me some issues with work because it's only 8gb and it's also underpowered to help boost battery performance. So far, I've been surprised to find that this low-powered RAM actually keeps up with me despite my issues with never exiting or closing windows, lol.\\n\\nThe keyboard is extremely comfortable if you have small to medium-sized hands. There is some time to adjust to the smaller form factor. Large handed people will immediately hate the keyboard because it's compact. This being said, it IS a large keyboard as far as COMPACT keyboards go, and it is 100% identical to the keyboard on the Macbook Air. Same feel and everything. Backlit keys, which you can switch on or off. Something SUPER cool is that Acer figured out how to include a Numlock and number keypad on it by marking some of the letter keys with numbers, then adding a Numlock. (check my pictures)\\n\\nIf you turn on the manual equalizer in the audio settings and crank it up, the speakers actually get really loud, and they're nice that way too (no rattle, no stress on the drivers). By default though, I can easily see tons of folks complaining about the speakers not getting loud. They don't get loud at all by default. With the equalizer maxed out, I would compare them to a mini Bluetooth speaker.\\n\\nIn short, don't buy this for audio unless you're planning on connecting it to different speakers. For normal casual usage, like watching YouTube videos or streaming movies, the built-in speakers should be just fine.\\n\\nThe lid is very well hinged. The screen is reinforced as well. Dropping it may cause some cosmetic damage, but it should hold up in most cases. At the worst, you'll be looking at a little cosmetic damage (scratches, dings) and a busted screen. Which is better than what you could face with the typical plastic body. I once dropped a plastic body laptop off the back of my car (I was an idiot and left it on the hood). It totally destroyed the body... the laptop still worked, but there was bare PCB board everywhere. It was ugly, lol.\\n\\nNow, there are complaints about battery life on this, but I haven't had any problems. I also didn't go with default settings in some key areas, though. I changed the Radeon settings to focus more on battery life than performance. Then I changed the power settings to best battery life. Now, I don't consider this to be much, especially with my huge collection of background apps, but considering complaints saying the battery wouldn't last more than an hour... hmmm. I'm not seeing it. I've been on battery for an hour now, and have 12h 46m remaining after charging to 98%. I'm guessing the expected battery life will hang somewhere between 4.5h and 6h on medium.\\n\\nOverall, it's a great machine and an awesome value in my book. I have no idea why the pro reviewers thought so poorly of it (though they did give it respect as a budget laptop). Maybe they were comparing it to more expensive laptops instead of comparing it to other models in this price range....? Or maybe the older version of this was really that bad.\\n\\nWhatever. I'm sticking with this because IT WORKS.\\n\\nUpdate: Two months later... it's still running like the day I got it. I'm actually shocked that it continues to perform so well on 8GB of energy saving RAM. I am guessing the difference lies in a combo of using a better processor and using a solid state drive. My other laptop has an A12, which is quad core and goes up to 3ghz - this Ryzen 7 is octacore and goes up to 4ghz.\\n\\nThe Care Center app has a function in it to make the battery only change to 80% when it's plugged in (saves the battery cells from being burned out). So despite using it plugged in all the time, I have not lost any battery health. It still goes for six hours or more off battery.\",\n",

The battery life is unimpressive, and the processing \"power\" that so many ostensibly professional reviewers were blown away by has been noticeably absent. Often opening a simple menu will cause the cursor icon to visibly stutter. And the heat that this thing produces, even on stand-by, leads me to believe it will be a very short lived piece of hardware.\\n\\nWorst of all, and most inexcusable, using anything other than the bloated installation of Windows 10 it comes with is made essentially impossible by the complete and total lack of driver support. Simple things like the touchpad won\\'t work, and Acer couldn\\'t be bothered to make those drivers available.

Ive seen and read the horror stories people posted on reviews and reddit about Razer\\'s QC. I also have seen very satisfied customers too so I prayed for the best. Luckily my unit after I have been using for about 3,4 days now have no problem at all. I see no major screen bleeding at all there is very small bleed on the right hand corner but basically that\\'s it.\\n\\nThe keyboards are not very to my liking. I was using Lenovo Y520 before this and even on that cheap model, the keyboards were way better for me. I think that the blade keyboards are abit too mushy for me.\\n\\nThe speakers are also abit on the weaker side. I wish they would just be a little more meaty. I\\'m not sure how to explain it but even my old Lenovo was better and i hated those.\\n\\nThe top part of the chassis near the screen gets VERY hot when under heavy loud like gaming. I couldnt touch it for more than 3,4 seconds, but then again noone touches that area anyway so it doesnt really matter. It also got cool to the touch very fast though after you stop gaming which really surprised me.\\n\\nAll in all those are really the only thing I \"dislike\". They really are nit picky but im actually really pleased with this device. I will try to post here again if i encounter any problems later on. For now i think they are great. I also mostly see reported problems on last year\\'s model with the i7 9th gen and this years 1660ti gpu model. If I were you I would try to avoid those and get the more expensive one just in case.

They have some false advertisements on the page. the main one being the store page says it has a touch screen, while it doesn't. Had to talk to 4 reps trying to add the insurance to the purchase (store page says you can add it up to 30 days from purchase) only to be told they couldn't do it. 3 of the people just hung up without saying a word. The last one said all I can do to get what I wanted is to return the laptop, wait 2-3 weeks for amazon to receive it (even though I got it in one) and then wait another week for my refund, then repurchase the laptop and add the insurance. while I would like very much to do that, I need this laptop for work as well as gaming so I can't really be without it for so long.\\n\\nOh, and as it's an expensive delivery, they require a signature for drop off.

I suspect due to the 'chip shortage' Dell was forced to dive into the ol' parts bin and ship this particular 3583 with an older - and MUCH lower specs - Pentium Gold 5th generation CPU with limited cache. To try to compensate, Dell also shipped this unit with a M.2 SSD rather than the spec'd spinning HDD. That was very good of them. But the mis-match seems to be creating some lag in 'getting things done', although not critical. I may (probably) be wrong about this, but then I'm not a computer whiz. It would be great if Dell eventually tracked this order and in future shipped us a comparable Core i3 CPU with a realistic cache. Hey, I can dream!

I was waiting to at least have this for 30 days to update this so here we go. The specs of this laptop are pretty decent and RAM card is upgradable which is great but apparently SSD is not but I bought an external one and it's working fine so no complaints there.

Software wise I had an issue with the explorer.exe getting extremely slow, which was a pain to deal with, now to be fair this could've been related to a specific software I installed but I couldn't fully confirm this. For the moment being everything is working well but it feels kinda fragile in a software spect.

       " 'Dell Inspiron 13 5310, 13.3 Inch QHD (Quad High Definition) Non-Touch Laptop - Intel Core i7-11370H, 16GB DDR4 RAM, 512GB SSD, NVIDIA GeForce MX450 with 2GB GDDR6, Platinum Silver (Latest Model)\\n\\nThe laptop comes securely packaged in a recyclable cardboard box, with molded cardboard padding holding the laptop inside. I like to see that big companies are being more conscious about recycling materials with their shipping. Besides the laptop, inside the box, you will find the USBC power supply and two small pamphlets, one for warranty and safety rags and one for a quick start guide, including a QR code so you can go directly to the Dell support page if you have a difficulty. flipping through the pages there\\'s not a lot of information here you get the basic info and locations of all the buttons, camera, and speakers, as well as very basic information for the device. That\\'s not unusual these days, as many laptop manufacturers are putting the instruction manuals online, or on the device itself. I put the laptop on to charge while I went about my day, as most devices are not shipped with a full charge.\\nTurning the laptop on for the first time, the power button is not labeled as such, because it is the same button as the fingerprint scanner. I thought this was a little strange at first, but the more I thought about it, it made sense because once you turn it on you\\'ll need to scan your print to unlock it. As the laptop starts, it launches into the middle of Windows installation, because you\\'re actually installing Windows for the first time when you turn on a new laptop. The default settings for the startup uses Cortana to narrate the setup procedures and walk you through the procedure. You can control most of it by voice and answering questions, or you can turn the speaker off and enjoy the quiet while you press buttons. The default sound setting for the laptop is about half / 50% of full, which is still pretty loud for Cortana. The keys are backlit and have three settings only, two intensity settings low and high, and off. In the process of setting up, it asks you to log in with your Microsoft account. If you have more than one Windows device, I heartily recommend creating a Microsoft account if you don\\'t have one already. Not only will it register that copy of Windows with Microsoft so you never have to worry about losing the key, but you can also use your phone for two-factor authentication and not have to worry about remembering your password every time you log into Microsoft. Also, for further securing your laptop, this model offers a fingerprint sensor. I very much recommend that you use it, and add a second finger after the setup finishes, just in case you ever have a Band-Aid on your first finger. That\\'s happened to me before and I had to mess about with trying to remember security codes instead of simply scanning my fingerprint in a half a second. You can even set up your phone to communicate with Windows now so that while you\\'re on your laptop you can get your messages right on the computer. They also include a 1-month trial of Microsoft 365, which will come in handy if you plan on purchasing the Microsoft 365 family which according to the computer is $100 a year plus taxes. That\\'s a little too expensive for me, so I declined it. I can\\'t see spending that much for Microsoft office when excellent substitutions that work with the same documents such as open office are available for free. The laptop also comes with McAfee security, which I\\'m sure is a trial. As soon as the trial is up, I plan on uninstalling McAfee and going with Windows defender. In my opinion, McAfee takes up way too many resources. After you set these up, Windows finalizes set up with a great big blue screen that says quote this might take several minutes, don\\'t turn off your PC, leave everything to us \". After a fairly short time, windows will boot to your basic windows desktop. The resident program shortcuts that are installed with the machine are Microsoft Edge, file explorer, the Microsoft store, your mailbox, My Dell Support, and Alexa. Also, since I logged in with my Microsoft account and agreed to sync with the rest of my computers, it pulled my desktop shortcuts and those are placed onto my desktop as well. Once it finishes that, you get a pop-up to register your computer with Dell for warranty activation, expedited diagnostics, and product updates. Using the keyboard to type in my information to register for the warranty, I find the keys to be soft but have a secure almost \" click \" feeling to it as you make your keystrokes. I like that it has this tactile feeling to it because even though I am not a touch typer, sometimes I do type fairly quickly and I like to feel the key action as I type.\\nOnce all of the setups are complete, I like to run Windows updates. Even though when you open Windows update if it says you have no updates, press the button again because, sure enough! There is a bunch of updates. No matter how brand new your computer is, there\\'s bound to be a bunch of updates that have been created between the time your computer was manufactured and shipped to you and turn it on once you have it on your hands. Don\\'t be afraid to restart Windows and run updates until there are no more updates available. In the process of running these updates, I heard the fan turn on for the first time. It did take a little while for the machine to get warm enough to need the fan, and I was happy to see that the fan was very quiet and not noisy at all.\\nIn downloading and installing my preferred programs, one of the things I prefer is Google Chrome for my main browser, [sorry edge], and I found it interesting to see that as I was typing “ download Google Chrome \" into the address/search bar, that after only a couple of letters it auto-completed the phrase to download Google Chrome. Somehow that says something about how many people don\\'t enjoy Edge as their preferred browser.\\nOnce you have everything up and running, you\\'ll get a push notification to update the Dell support assistant. It\\'s actually a handy program that will, with a little help from you, keep your computer 100% up-to-date with driver downloads, hardware configuration as well as tuning up your performance, and optimizing your internet connections. One thing I did find interesting about the Dell support Assistant, is it also carried an update to the BIOS firmware, which I thought was a little unusual but not unwelcome. Don\\'t be surprised if this takes a few minutes.\\nEnd using this laptop for my everyday tasks, I\\'m pretty happy with how speedy and snappy it is, and the screen is crisp and clean. watching a streaming movie on it definitely came through in high definition.\\nThe bottom line on this laptop? It\\'s very light, supremely portable, and has horsepower under the hood to do the job. I don\\'t often give five stars to a device like this, but I think it deserves it. I very much recommend this laptop.',\n",

       " 'SUMMARY\\nA surprisingly well-rounded and well equipped budget chromebook that doesn\\'t get the attention it deserves.\\n\\nLEAD-UP TO THE PURCHASE\\nHaving recently given my Google Pixelbook to a friend who was in desperate need of a computer, I was in the market for another chromebook... just in time for Prime Day June 2021. I didn\\'t need a powerhouse since I have learned firsthand that running Linux on a chromebook sounds better on paper than it does in real life use.\\n\\nThe 2-in-1 form-factor was fun to tinker with but in practical day-to-day use, I found it better to use a dedicated Android tablet (Samsung Galaxy Tab S6) for touch and pen tasks. A traditional clamshell design would be fine for those \"laptop-y\" things... and an 11\" or so screen would allow for a very portable device.\\n\\nPRIME DAY HUNTING\\nWith those requirements in mind, I went hunting in the Amazon (see what I did there? ;-) ) for a suitable chromebook. I found that most of the deals were for devices that had been released two or more years ago. A few other \"deals\" weren\\'t any cheaper than the regular prices at other stores (for the same processor/RAM/storage configurations).\\n\\nI ran across the Lenovo Chromebook 3 (LCB3 for short) and it really intrigued me. Not only was it quite inexpensive, but it had a decent processor (Celeron N4020), decent storage (64GB), and more ports (2-USBC, 2 USBA 3.0, microSD card slot, and headphone/mic jack) than my old Google Pixelbook (2 USBC, headphone/mic jack).\\n\\nI watched some reviews on Youtube for this device and only one gave it a half-decent review. In spite of the lack of glowing reviews, I purchased it.\\n\\nUNBOXING AND USE\\nWhen the LCB3 arrived and I opened the box, I was impressed with the look and feel of this chromebook. I don\\'t have to qualify this comment with (...for a $170 chromebook). No, it is legitimately a good looking and feeling chromebook, period.\\n\\nThe lid has a tasteful Lenovo branding plate on it and a section of the lid has a fine gray hash pattern stenciled on that gives it an interesting and attractive look.\\n\\nThe screen is a matte screen... yes! I\\'ve always been a fan of matte screens (especially on Thinkpads) and although the reviewers complained that it wasn\\'t a bright display, I found it to be just fine in the places I typically use a notebook-type device.\\n\\nThe keyboard isn\\'t the same as that found on Lenovo\\'s other laptops, but it feels stable and quite acceptable for long typing sessions.\\n\\nThe trackpad works well and is consistent.\\n\\nBattery life is extremely good. I haven\\'t run it all the way down yet, but on multiple occasions, I\\'ve run it on battery mostly surfing and typing for 3-4 hours and the projected battery life remaining registered 10+ hours. I don\\'t know how true that is, but I\\'ll try to run it all the way down and update with the results.\\n\\nPerformance is more than adequate. The combination of the Celeron N4020 and the lower screen resolution results in a very smooth and responsive experience.\\n\\nTAKE THE EXPERT REVIEWERS\\' OPINIONS WITH A GRAIN OF SALT\\nBecause expert reviewers have access to a wide variety of devices, (many of them high-end), they can have their perspectives skewed a bit. It\\'s nothing personal against them, it\\'s how we\\'re all wired. That seems to be evident in their review and coverage of the LCB3.\\n\\nLenovo has been \"killing it\" (in a good way) lately in the chromebook space. Their Chromebook Duet gets most of the attention, but this LCB3 is the hidden gem in their recently released chromebooks.\\n\\nI\\'ve owned the older Lenovo ThinkPad chromebooks in the past, but the LCB3 feels more like a ThinkPad than those officially branded ThinkPad chromebooks were. I\\'m baffled as to why expert reviewers haven\\'t given this device more attention.\\n\\nI was initially concerned about how well the few Android apps I rely on would work on a non-touchscreen chromebook, but so far, they work as expected.\\n\\nI\\'m delighted with the LCB3 and it will fit nicely with how I use my chromebooks. I hope this is helpful to those who are considering purchasing the Chromebook 3.',\n",
       " 'This is a very light Chromebook. Easy to carry, very portable.\\n\\nThe product description on Amazon has this Chromebook listed as a \"touchscreen\" Chromebook. If you scroll down to the section titled \"Choose the right Lenovo Chromebook for you\" you will see that this model has a check-mark in the \"Touchscreen\" row. Unfortunately, this Chromebook most certainly does not have a touchscreen. You must use the touch-pad and keyboard for all input.\\n\\nI love that it is quick, and it is very easy to setup. I am happy with its performance. I also love that it has a large drive for storage, long life battery and a very clear display.\\n\\nOverall, I am lukewarm about this Chromebook. To me, the price seems a bit high for a Chromebook with these features. They seriously need to fix the product description. I\\'m giving it 3 stars.',\n",
       " ' I use a Chromebook almost as much as I use an iMac throughout my daily work and play computing activities. I love Chromebooks for their ease of use with a Google Gmail account, their inexpensive price point, and their battery life. But they are not a laptop replacement and rarely have good displays or sound. This Lenovo IdeaPad 3 is no different.\\n\\n➡️ UNBOXING:\\nThe IdeaPad 3 Chromebook is 11.6\" which fit snuggly into the packaging with its AC power supply. There was no wiggling around going on as the Chromebook was securely packaged and arrived unharmed. A small user manual accompanies the device, and the serial number (for registration of the Chromebook) is on the box.\\n\\n➡️ REGISTRATION & WARRANTY:\\nRegistration will require the serial number and your date of purchase, as well as being a registered user on the Lenovo website. Once your device is registered you can see how many days left on your warranty there are - this device comes with a 1-year warranty - and if you send it in for a repair (by mail) the status of the repair.\\n\\n➡️ FIRST IMPRESSIONS:\\nThe compact, 11.6\" size of this Chromebook makes it ideal for students or travelers, particularly those who want to upload photos to the cloud using the micro-SD slot. The plastic case is smooth (no texture) with a matte finish, and fingerprints easily show up on it, but not as easily as they would if it were gloss black.\\n\\nThe keyboard is full-size (no numbers to the side), but there is no backlighting which was a disappointment for me as I do a lot of work at night in low-light conditions. The keyboard is comfortable to type on with very little play or noise when typing. The touchpad is responsive.\\n\\nThe display is technically HD (1366x768 which can be set to 1518 x 853 in the display settings - smaller text, but sharper and my preference), but that doesn\\'t mean it\\'s super-sharp and clear. It isn\\'t. It\\'s washed out and angles dictate what you see and how you see it. This is not a touchscreen.\\n\\nThere is a 720P integrated webcam that provides slightly grainy stills and video, especially in low light. The speakers are downward-facing on either side of the bottom front of the Chromebook, making them easily muffled if the Chromebook is on anything other than a completely flat desktop. (Use a laptop stand where the speakers are not obscured, 3.5mm headphones, or Bluetooth earbuds, or a speaker.)\\n\\nThe AC charger is on par build-wise as the Chromebook itself. With care, both are adequate for daily use.\\n\\nThe Lenovo IdeaPad 3 is a plain-looking, 11.6\" Chromebook with a utilitarian feel. There\\'s nothing that sets it apart in the way that it looks or feels, and while not unexpected, a bit disappointing.\\n\\n--------------------------------------\\n\\n➡️ WHAT I LIKE ABOUT USING THIS CHROMEBOOK:\\n1. It\\'s very lightweight.\\n2. The keyboard is comfortable to use.\\n3. The battery life is excellent! (Averaged 9.5 hours per charge, which took about 2 hours to complete.)\\n4. It works as expected. Easy to set up in less than 5 minutes with a Google Gmail account.\\n5. USB (3.1) ports (2) on both sides of the device.\\n6. 3.5mm headphone jack for wired headphones.\\n7. Latest Bluetooth (4.2) connectivity.\\n8. A microSD card reader slot - a rarity! Allows for easy uploads to the cloud, accessing things like movies on the go from a microSD card, or having additional storage that isn\\'t connected via a USB port.\\n9. USB Type-C ports (2); one on each side - a smart way to add ports (on each side) in my opinion, and not something all manufacturers do.\\n10. 1-Year warranty with mail-in repairs was easy to register on the Lenovo website.\\n11. You can get an external, portable monitor to connect to this Chromebook via USB or USB-C and have two displays.\\n12. Celeron processor with zippy (64GB) drive and 4MB integrated graphics works and plays well together.\\n13. Super-fast setup with Gmail account. Access to G-Suite (Drive, Sheets, etc...), Chrome browser bookmarks, and Google Store apps.\\n\\n➡️ WHAT COULD BE BETTER ABOUT THIS CHROMEBOOK:\\n1. The display is OK, but not great. Turning the size of the text down to the smallest size makes for sharper viewing, but may be uncomfortable for some. You can adjust the size of what you are viewing in the Chrome browser settings, so playing with this may be helpful too. The display has a matte finish and viewing angles really affect the color saturation and clarity.\\n2. The webcam is 720P and it gets the job done, but not well.\\n3. No backlighting behind the keyboard keys. For me, a major disappointment as I often work at night.\\n4. The sound lacks depth and unless you are using earbuds or an external source, it\\'s a little disappointing for watching movies or listening to music.\\n5. No ethernet port - not surprising or expected, but I still like the idea of having one. You can get an adapter (dongle) for USB that will give you one though.\\n\\n------------------------------------\\n\\n🎯 CONCLUSION:\\nThe one thing that this Chromebook has the few have is a micro-SD slot which is great for photographers who want to upload their photos to cloud storage or to access and/or create additional, on-device storage. It\\'s compact and easy to throw into a small bag, and it has up to 10-hour battery life, making it a cheap computer with lots of utilitarian use for those who work in the Google ecosystem.\\n\\nThe lackluster sound and display are disappointing, but not unexpected. They get the job done, but little else. And the display is not a touchscreen, which many around the same price do have.\\n\\nThe bottom line - it\\'s a compact, utilitarian Chromebook that can work for home, office, and travel, but it\\'s nothing special and lacks good speakers, a quality webcam, and a sharp, touchscreen display. It\\'s got the Lenovo brand backing it up with a 1-year, mail-in service warranty.\\n\\nIf you don\\'t mind a black box that just works as expected without many bells and whistles, then this one may be for you.\\n-------------------------------------------\\n\\nUPDATE: Several days on standby have the battery holding steady with no depletion.\\n\\n------------------------------------------',\n",

I plan to use a cooling platform at home, but I could see this being an issue in the field.\\n\\nThe power connector that runs into the PC isn't exactly robust, and it's shorter than other laptop connectors I've seen. It feels like something that could break easily, perhaps taking the power port with it. Also, the brick at the end of the power cord is two and a half inches square, an inch thick on all the sides, and the two prongs are slightly offset from one end. This could be a problem with certain outlets and power strips.\\n\\nIt comes loaded with (at first glance) less crapware than normal, but there are a couple of games I can't delete, and it has the dreaded, resource-hogging Norton security suite on it.

       " \"I think that this Chromebook from HP brings a lot to the table for under $350, the design is nice despite being mostly plastic. It doesn't have big ugly bezels around the display like the last Chromebook I reviewed. It honestly resembles a Macbook, although many brands are going for this aluminum look with a black keyboard and black around the screen. This is a 2 in 1, so it can flip around and be used solely as a tablet, and it's not too thick to pull this off like many Chromebooks are.\\n\\nChrome OS does have some limitations, but it has matured a lot in the last 5 or so years. You can run android apps from the Google PlayStore, as well as sideloading android apps from the web with a little know-how. You can also setup a Linux VM and install native Linux apps like Libre Office. Of course, most of the Operating System is intended for web based stuff within the Chrome web browser. There is also a new feature to link up your Android phone to Chromebooks, allowing you to receive android notifications on the laptop and be able to send text messages. It also will not lock your laptop while your smartphone is nearby. This is for Android only, iPhones cannot take advantage of these features.\\n\\nChromebooks, by design have less on board storage than a conventional laptop. But this one has 64GB and offers a lot of options for external storage. The port selection is great, 2x USB C ports, 1x USB A port, all 3 ports are 5 gigabit, 3.2 gen 1 (formerly known as USB 3.0) which gives you decently fast transfer speeds. You also get a Micro SD slot and a headphone jack. The two USB C ports are full featured ports, meaning that they support video out, power in, and data. This is great for future proofing. You can charge the laptop on either side thanks to each side having its own port.\\n\\nBattery life is good, I got between 6-9 hours depending on screen brightness and what exactly I was doing on the machine. It supports fast charging and you can recharge the battery to 50% in only 45 minutes. Performance is also good, this laptop has an Intel Pentium Silver N5000. That's a lower end Intel chip, but it's still a decent enough 4 core CPU for a Chromebook. Likewise, the 4GB of RAM is sufficient as well for Chrome OS. Web pages load very quickly with no lag, while using this laptop I haven't been frustrated with poor performance or any kind of jankyness (and I have high standards, I normally use a much more expensive device than this one). In my opinion, this is what makes Chromebooks so appealing- you actually can get a good experience from a laptop that is less than $350 and that just is not true on the windows side (and certainly not on Apple laptops).\\n\\nThe keyboard is good on this laptop, a decent enough key travel that doesn't feel mushy. My typing was as accurate as on my main laptop. I do wish it were backlit, but I will say that about every keyboard that isn't.\\nThe trackpad is one of the better plastic ones that I've used. The finish is smooth and allows for easy scrolling and moving the cursor around. It has a very tactile click that I really enjoy. The speakers are also above average for the price, some laptop speakers in this price range are tinny and have a rattle to them. This has stereo speakers that borders the keyboard on both sides. They have bass to them and are enjoyable to use when watching videos on Youtube or streaming service of choice.\\n\\nNow let's talk about the screen, it's 1366x768 touch screen. That is slightly higher than 720P resolution, it's detailed enough for browsing the web or navigating chrome OS. It would have been nice to seen them include a full HD screen, but they did not. I would say that it's a pretty average laptop screen for the $350 price. It's not amazing, but I think it's good enough for most people. The touch response is good and using this as a tablet is feasible. It will end up being a slightly heavier and thicker tablet than something like an iPad, but it's still thinner than many Chromebooks that offer this functionality.\\n\\nI think that there is a lot here to like from this laptop, if you can live with chrome OS then this will be a great device for you. Just make sure you understand the limitations (of Chrome OS), the laptop is a compelling buy for $340. The only thing about it that I'm not into is the quality of the display, but I think it will be good enough for most, given the overall package.\\n\\nUpdate: This device had no problems on 5Ghz WiFi, wireless performance was good on multiple networks.\\n\\nPros+\\n\\n2 USB C ports that support charging, fast data transfer, and video out to external displays\\n\\nFast 45 watt USB C Power Delivery charging (0-50% in 45 minutes)\\n\\nModern design with smaller bezels and an overall attractive look\\n\\nGood keyboard and trackpad\\n\\nPerformance is snappy thanks to the x86 Intel quad core Gemini lake Pentium Silver N5000\\n\\nSpeakers actually sound good\\n\\nCons-\\n\\nScreen is not Full HD (1080P) and the colors look a little washed out or faded\",\n",
       " 'Exactly what I expected! Battery life lasts forever and the touch screen makes my school work easy! Love this laptop!',\n",
       " \"I feel like Chromebooks are either unknown or misunderstood by many. While my kids have had Chomebooks in the past, I've never owned one myself. So for me, this is a relatively new experience and it's been very positive. Overall, this is a very good pairing of hardware and software to provide most people what they need for nearly all daily activities from a PC. This is being used as a casual family room PC.\\n\\nFirst of all, the HP hardware is pretty darn good for the price at which this device sells for. It's a very clean design and feels pretty sturdy if held by one hand. I've had more expensive laptops feel like they were going to break if held in the same way. I would say the keyboard is on par of other laptops in this price range. One complaint that I have is the sharp edge where you'd place your palms while typing. I would have preferred it was a little more rounded out, but it's not a game changer. I'll have to see what it's like over the long term.\\n\\nThe screen is also very similar to screens at this price. Not the greatest of viewing angles, but has excellent touch response. The viewing angles only become a problem if/when you use as a tablet. Speaking of which, I love that the screen folds all the way back so that it can be used as a tablet. That's a great feature and I wish all laptops were capable of doing that.\\n\\nBattery life seems to be really great. I'm able to use this on and off over 2 or 3 days without a charge. This is really with regular web browsing, so no movies/music to really drain the battery.\\n\\nFinally, Chrome OS is very simple and lightweight. I like how some web apps appear as installed applications as opposed to web pages in the Chrome web browser. I've also enabled the Linux beta VM, which has allowed me to install the Brave web browser. I prefer that over Chrome for it's safety and ad-blocking features. It's seems to work just fine, although it may be a bit slower then Chrome.\\n\\nSo far, I'm incredibly pleased with this Chromebook. I feel it offers a great value and an experience that is better then I expected. Highly recommended!\",\n",

I like the antitheft feature with the space to carry your phone or passport on the backside close to your body, as well as the roll down top. There is a strap that buckles across your chest to keep the shoulder straps positioned correctly and to keep from sliding off.

       " \"As many parents are home schooling or online schooling it has become a little hard to find a place to keep our children's laptops or tablets in a good position. This is especially hard for smaller children. This laptop stand is very handy as you can place a laptop/tablet on it to get the perfect position. You can adjust the height and the angle that best suits you or your child. It has a space so the device can remain cool and not heat up. I love that I can move it around which has made it a lot more fun for my child to sit outside in a table and enjoy his class sessions outside. It can be very difficult having the tablets not have a sturdy place to be placed on without falling over and potentially breaking. This has been so convenient! We love that he can adjust the height and even work stading up to stretch our legs. You don't have to be crouching to look at your device. I have also used it to hold our tablet while we cook and watch tutorials online. It is not heavy at all and comes with a storage bag. Lays down flat for easy storage. Highly recommend this very useful laptop stand!\",\n",
       " 'This met all my expectations! I was worried it would be wobbly but it’s actually really sturdy. I have a MacBook Pro 13in, so it’s heavier than most laptops, and it fits nicely. Like some other reviews have said, it’s hard to pry it apart to get it to the right height. But after some wiggling and straining I did. It actually made me feel good that I had to struggle with it because that meant it was tight enough to stay in place. It doesn’t really jiggle when I type on the laptop while it’s in the stand, but I normally use a separate keyboard so I can’t say for certain it won’t shake when you’re using it. One thing I really like is that the two tabs on the front that hold the computer in place are spaced apart. I looked at a few that just had a bar in the middle but that would have made it difficult to get to the groove in my laptop where I open it. Since the two tabs are spaced apart I can easily open the laptop without moving it. So, I’m conclusion, this is a really good stand that does exactly what I need it to do. It looks professional (not cheap) and is sturdy. I’d recommend it.',\n",

The HP has vents and a small fan to help the computer cooler, however, when you lay it on a flat surface ther is not much space for air to flow to keep the machine cool. This stand lets you raise the base above the surface nearly 1.5\" up to about 9\" . The screen obviouslly is higher so you can see it while standing perhaps reading a book or recipies while cooking. At lower levels the base is adjustable to make typing angles more comfortable.

       " 'I bought this laptop for light audio work and general use on Linux and it really blew me away. Is it a $700, $800 laptop? Absolutely not, but if you need a good laptop that CAN charge with USB-C PD, has good battery life (5-12hrs depending on how hard it\\'s pushed and if it\\'s using Linux or Windows), and a beautiful display, this is the computer for you. The quad core processor is actually a pretty decent little chip but while it beats out the Celeron N series chips in most budget laptops, it obviously doesn\\'t hold a candle to a core i5 or Ryzen 3 laptop. If your use case doesn\\'t require a lot of CPU or GPU, this is a fantastic laptop and nothing comes close to it in price.\\n\\nIt is a pretty good Windows laptop and has no issues with anything except lots of Chrome tabs but Firefox works really well with the modest specs of this laptop. I installed Pop!_OS Linux after a few days and the difference was pretty impressive. Battery life went up by about 20-50% depending on the workload and CPU usage was also lower when idling or doing light tasks.\\n\\nThe BIOS can be hard to find but pressing the delete or escape key on startup will put you in the menu and for those interested in installing Linux, you\\'ll want to go to the south bridge (yes it has a south bridge) settings to change the OS it\\'s looking for from Windows to Linux.\\n\\nThe screen is obviously the star of the show here and it is truly amazing, especially in the 3:2 aspect ratio but I\\'m going to focus on some other aspects that may be less clear. The top of the laptop, i.e. behind the display is aluminum and feels pretty sturdy but the rest of the body is made of plastic. I\\'m usually not a fan of plastic but it\\'s color matched well and feels almost as good as the aluminum while doing a better job of keeping the bits you touch from getting hot when the laptop is really working.\\n\\nThe touchpad is plastic but it is definitely on the larger side, large enough that there is no room for a single complaint about it not being big enough. The first few days it feels a bit rough but after that the touchpad becomes quite smooth and nice to use so when you first try to use it and your finger bounces across the surface, don\\'t worry it\\'ll get better. The left and right click buttons are integrated under the touchpad so you press on the bottom of the touchpad and it\\'ll click I\\'d you don\\'t like the one/two finger click style.\\n\\nThe keyboard is also plastic and while it\\'s not amazing, it feels like a $500-$600 laptop keyboard, not like a bottom of the barrel keyboard. A big part of what gives it that good feel is the tactility. It has a good amount of key travel, probably a bit more than average for a laptop and the keys don\\'t feel totally mushy. They have a travel to them that allows you to feel when a key has been pressed, it\\'s not totally linear as it has what I would describe as a miniscule drop at the bottom of the press that helps you feel when something is pressed. The keys can shift a little with sideways force but it\\'s certainly not the worst I\\'ve felt and definitely fine considering the $349.99 price point I purchased it at.\\n\\nThe RAM and storage are well more than enough to get you off the ground and it even has an M.2 2280 extension bay that I have yet to test but I\\'ll try to update the review when I do so I can confirm if it works with NVMe or just SATA M.2 drives. (I tried an NVMe 1TB WD Green 2280 and Linux was unable to recognize it in the computer though the slot technically fits an NVMe. Not sure if it would work with Windows.) Note: the built-in storage is a SATA-III SSD, not NVMe though I wouldn\\'t expect it at this price and not the much slower eMMC storage many budget laptops unfortunately use. Also, I have yet to use more than 4.5GB RAM at a time so 12 is definitely overkill for this class of laptop (I did hit 6.2GB in Windows once).\\n\\nThe speakers... This is where some of the high praises are no longer that high although with an asking price this low, corners have to be cut somewhere. The stereo speakers are far from awful however they border \"decent\" and \"alright\". They fire from holes on the bottom of the laptop and get muffled if it\\'s on your lap. They do get recently loud and you can at least hear a tiny hint of bass so I\\'ll give them that. The headphone jack reveals that headphone listening is actually pretty good. I am an audiophile with decent but not crazy hardware and the on board dac does well enough that I don\\'t have any complaints though the audio gets a bit thin in the higher frequencies. The high notes don\\'t sound bad, there\\'s just a noticeable lack of some detail. I\\'ve heard audio from PC motherboards over half the price of this laptop that sound a good bit worse than what the audio jack on this laptop has to offer though so 9/10 there, great job Chuwi!\\n\\nThe fan on this laptop (it does have one) maxes out at 26-27 or so DBA which means a lightly whispered conversation will drown out the fans at full speed. I\\'ve only seen the fans kick on two times and both times, I was hammering the CPU and GPU at the same time for hours on end so while it technically has a fan, it\\'s super quiet, so quiet it\\'s basically fanless. At full tilt for hours on end the chassis right under the fan gets warm enough to be noticeable but the rest of the laptop stays impressively cool to the touch. I use my laptop on the go very often and it never gets warm enough to notice even when on my lap for long periods of time and that is a huge plus in my book.\\n\\nThe webcam is an 0.3MP unit so everything looks super soft and really, really bad. Like 2012 budget Android phone bad. This is NOT for video calls, this will look absolutely atrocious on any video calling platform. PLEASE do not use this for Zoom! Get a USB webcam. The camera is only there to tick the box on the spec sheet.\\n\\nThe hinge: I had actually heard some conflicting things about the build of the hinge when researching this laptop so I\\'ll try to clear things up a bit. The long, centered hinge is also made of plastic by the way and while it\\'s not super sturdy, it doesn\\'t feel like it\\'ll break too easily. That said I would still open and close it at a reasonable speed and not slam it shut because obviously it is still a budget laptop but overall it\\'s a good hinge.\\n\\nAnd that\\'s all I got! Hopefully this review was of some help to you and if so, please hit the \"Helpful\" button. I\\'ll continue to update this review as I use the laptop more. This review is currently based on 1 month of ownership.',\n",
       " 'Absolutely the best screen on any laptop even close to this price range (it uses the same panel as the Huawei Matebook 13 which literally costs 3 times as much). I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the rest of the laptop as well, sturdy aluminum/plastic shell, a very useable keyboard, and a decent webcam with optimal placement at the top of the screen. The storage and RAM are excellently sized for the price as well. The processor is not very powerful for a modern machine but definitely snappy enough for web browsing and word processing; it is MILES better than the Celeron N3350 in my old netbook which originally retailed for the same $350 price tag.\\n\\nOne issue with the laptop and I notice a few questions about it above - the laptop comes with Windows 10 but it it does NOT come with a valid activation key - see pictures. It seems that as a cost-cutting measure, CHUWI is using the same Windows key on many different laptop installations, which invalidates the activation.\\n\\nYou will still be able to use Windows as normal except for some personalization options, such as setting your own desktop wallpaper. There will also constantly be an \"Activate Windows\" watermark in the bottom right corner of your screen which can be mildly annoying. I am willing to live with it but I wish CHUWI was more forthcoming about this drawback to an otherwise fantastic budget laptop.',\n",

But back light timed out quickly, and had to touch a key to bring back on, and no way I found to change that setting. Performance was slow, but to be expected with the hardware components used.\\nHowever, there were major software issues. First, I could not get windows mail to work, even with updates, re-installing mail, etc. So after online research and finding no answers, tried resetting laptop. What a mess that made - when the computer finished resetting, only 1/4 of programs were re-installed. Only a few Windows programs, and nothing else.\\nDecided to return and exchange for another. When I received second one, all went well at first, and I thought it would be a winner. Everything went well, and even did a reset to make sure all worked properly. Spent a couple days getting everything setup, and finally sat back to watch Netflix, using blue tooth sound through my receiver. The blue tooth sound started \"cutting in and out\", making watching a movie impossible. Then tried mp music stored in computer - same results. Evidently a bad blue tooth card, or driver, but with all the different issues, I gave up and returned this one as well.\\nI think that with a little more work and QC, these laptops can be a good choice, but right now they seem to be plagued with problems.',\n",

It is just enough to see but cannot open fully wide.\\nThe built-in webcam is in an undersirable location. It’s under the screen versus above the screen show it makes me look like a giant talking down to the camera. But I use an external webcam so it’s not too bad.\\n\\nPerformance is good.

       " \" I recently purchased this Daysky Laptop computer and I must say I am impressed with a lot of the features and performance that it has. It comes with a built in N3450 Quad-Core processor at 2.2Ghz and so it works pretty fast when surfing the web or using various software applications. It is pre-installed with Windows 10, has 8GB RAM, and 256GB SSD which makes it an ideal laptop for basic home use and my kids school work while at home. It comes with a lot of peripheral items like a wireless mouse, mouse pad, USB HUB, keyboard cover, and charger that makes it a great setup for office or school work.\\n\\nI also like that I can insert a TG card, or connect external device if needing and allows me to keep multiple applications open at the same time if I am working in a big work project.\\n\\nThe laptop also has a thin screen being .59 inches and lightweight being between 5 and 6 pounds that makes it ideal for transport when I am traveling with my job. It is also equipped with a 14.1-inch screen, resolution that is FHD 1920 x 1080 and Intel HD graphics which gives the display a crisp and vibrant color that makes it a great computer for games, movies, and of course for daily use. It is also wifi and bluetooth capable. It has a great battery life that is nice when I am on the go and can't be near a place to charge it. It has a precision touchpad with multitouch support that makes navigation on it an easy process.\\n\\nOverall, I am impressed with the quality, durability, and design of this laptop and will be using it alot for all my online and work needs!\",\n",

I turned it on and the battery level was at maybe 30-40%. I downloaded Google Chrome (which took maybe 5-10 minutes) and the battery level was at 5%! The camera on this looks like it’s from 2005- plus the angle is horrible. Now, the worst part is the keyboard. I’ve attached a video to show what gibberish the keyboard comes up with. It will skip keys and sometimes replace them with different letters. The download speed is fast, but I can’t get past the broken keys. I tried doing my homework, and couldn’t even get a paragraph out without having to go back EVERY word and pressing the corresponding key a few times before it got it right.

       " 'This laptop had just come out & I had just found it in the search results when looking for my @73 year old Daddy who’s not real tech savvy a laptop he wanted to start using instead of being tied down to a desktop & the desktop is like 20 years old but I upgraded it & built it to last the test of time. This laptop came in a box that was just an Amazon prime box that arose no suspicion that it was a high end electronic device & after getting off the front porch & taking it to my Daddy he actually opened the laptop, found the power button, even tho the laptop was initially on when he lifted the lid the first time & in no time he was online & surfing the Internet & signing onto his sites with his saved passwords sheets & even had the Windows 10 updated & had the computer rocking. He showed me how some stuff worked instead of me having to show him cuz he said this particular computer laptop just made everything easy to get started up, it was as advertised with a huge amount of RAM & ROM & had a brilliantly bright screen that I’d head others still was dull. My Daddy couldn’t believe I got him this brand new 2021 laptop for less than $350 & to get a laptop so loaded with specs & great components like so much RAM, ROM, & a bigger than usual 256GB SSD Hard Drive & all the ports he could ever want with a keypad that was so flawless in its working & so sensitive to touch & made just right that my Dad won’t ever need a mouse to get moved around the screen like he thought either. This is one of the best laptops you’re gonna get cuz it’s lightning fast all the way around, from loading to shutting down to updating to surfing to streaming to watching or playing huge GB movies or games & it loads anything online videos & game streamings just as fast as it loads a downloaded program or app from a website or the Microsoft Store App with Windows 10 Professional, which is a great operating system period! Just using the SSD hard drive when you pull up programs on the W10 Professional operating system, & my Daddy never having an SSD hard drive before can already tell the difference & still can’t believe he got this most awesome of laptops, especially when he knew it was a brand new 2021 model & not a refurbished or a renewed open box laptop & that it came with a pretty fast processor from the biggest brand name processor chip producer in the world, Intel! All I know is this company who produced this laptop may be new kids on the block but they sure understand the phrase quality at a great reasonable price cuz this laptop should’ve cost all of $600 or more just because of the laptops specs & speed, cause it’s faster than any MSI or Alienware Gaming PC or laptop I’ve used before & it even has a bigger screen than most higher costing laptops of smaller 14” or less screen sizes. II don’t know how this company is gonna be able to keep up with the demand to buy one once folk find these laptops on Amazon when you consider all these high end performing components that are from some of the highest rated electronic & computer part company manufactures in the world, & to still get it for a ridiculously low price when it has all those brand name components & high end PC specs & I mean game PC kind of specs for a laptop at this given price!!! My Daddy’s completely satisfied with it & he & my Mama’s compliments on the laptop has got me wanting to get one of them instead of building me another laptop component by component & putting it together myself just cuz it comes so loaded & with Win10 Professional & it’s all visible on a regular sized 15.6” beautifully colored & bright sized screen & it’s still lightweight with no fans to cool down hard drive making it weigh less than 3 pounds & that regular screen makes online video watching easier than the 11,12,13, or 14” Amazon, Apple, & Google like tablets, net books, or small app running netbook from schools that function as our school kids’ laptops or PC’s, even though those raggedy things were bought years ago & never refurbished or renewed, just cleaned programs off & redistributed the following year after librarians said they’d keep the books like brand new & always fix & refurbish the component parts if necessary.',\n",

       " \"I bought this laptop for college, being a freshman I was looking for something affordable that would last. I got the core i5 10th gen and I am absolutely happy with my purchase. I had thought about getting a mac but price wise it was out of range. The pavilion is very smooth and crisp in a way. I use it for online class and I have to run some programs for my science classes. It has NOT let me down. I've been using it for about a month now and it still works like new. The setup took me like 15 minutes when I first got it. The only things that I believe could be a con for some is that the battery will not last a whole day. I start class at around 8:20 am and around 12 pm the battery is dead, there is a battery saver button tho and it usually let's my battery last an extra hour or so. Tablet mode is fun, I don't usually use it so I have no comment on that. Regardless, very good product for the price. Would 100% recommend for college students. I don't think this would be a good choice for gaming tho. (sorry for the stickers!)\\n\\nEdit: it has been almost a year since I bought this laptop. It's very sturdy tho it seems light, I've dropped it a few times and it doesn't have a scratch on it. I take it with me on my backpack (usually besides my tennis racket) again, no dents or scratches. I dropped water on it too a few times, works like new (not saying that it is waterproof, maybe I was lucky) but very strong overall. I've taken a few coding classes that include python, HTML, and CSS and it runs it with no problem. It is very fast, very very fast, personally I keep photos, music, documents and such in an USB which leaves my laptop pretty empty so it could be because of that. Camera is pretty good, gets you through zoom, speakers are good as well. Overall, a year later and I still think this laptop is a 5/5.\",\n",
       " 'HP Pavilion x360 14-inch 2-in-1 Convertible Laptop, Intel Core i5, 8 GB RAM, 512 GB SSD Storage, Intel UHD Graphics, Windows 10 Home, Amazon Alexa Voice Compatible (14-dh2011nr, Natural Silver)\\n\\nLook and Feel\\nWith the exception of the hinges, the laptop shell is entirely made of plastic. The finish on the top (opposite the screen) is painted to mimic the look of brushed aluminum. It looks pretty convincing whilst it\\'s new but I expect that as it gets scratched over the course of its lifetime it will be very obvious even from a distance that it\\'s just painted plastic.\\n\\nThe hinge is very nicely designed, moves smoothly and holds sturdily. There\\'s no wiggle or play, it\\'s just very solid.\\n\\nThe whole thing weighs in at 3 lb 9 oz. not counting the power adapter.\\n\\nKeyboard\\nThe keyboard layout is comfortable and doesn\\'t have any unusual key placement or size. This may not seem noteworthy if you\\'ve never used a laptop that did something strange with the keyboard (I\\'m looking at you Lenovo), but trust me, it matters.\\n\\nAnother nice thing about a fairly standardized keyboard layout is the ready availability of keyboard covers. Although this model is not specifically listed as compatible, this cover fits perfectly: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B076KKYXXR. I\\'ve had more than one device saved by silicone keyboard covers like this and I strongly recommend them for anyone buying one of these. (I\\'m not recommending any cover specifically, merely providing an example of one that perfectly fits. This way you can take the model numbers from that listing and look for others if you like)\\n\\nThe keys themselves are well-designed low-profile keys. They\\'re quiet and responsive. I don\\'t have any problems with bounce and the (mostly) full-width keys are still comfortable under my large hands.\\n\\nThe keyboard backlight is very well designed. Each of the keys including its alternate function (punction etc...) are illuminated cleanly. There are three backlight levels, though I find the lower intensity unnecessary as the default setting is bright enough to see in a brightly lit room and not overpowering in a dark room.\\n\\nTouchpad\\nThe touchpad is basically standard fare. It\\'s designed well enough that I didn\\'t find myself accidentally moving the mouse pointer while typing. Though I still prefer a USB mouse, the touchpad is very serviceable.\\n\\nDisplay\\nThe screen is extremely glossy and will reflect absolute anything remotely bright behind you. It\\'s not terribly noticeable when you\\'re working with bright/white content on the screen - such as in a word processor or reading most web pages, but when there is darker content on the screen as often happens when watching videos it\\'s surface becomes like a mirror. That didn\\'t seem like a good design choice to me but maybe having a mirror finish is necessary because it\\'s a touch-screen?\\n\\nThe edge-lit IPS does offer a bright and clear image, though it\\'s not as bright as I would like. Since I don\\'t have a reliable method for measuring nits my evaluation of its brightness is going to be subjective. In summer noontime daylight it\\'s noticeably dimmer than other 300 nit screens I have tested, though it is still somewhat readable if you stay in the shade so I would guestimate it\\'s brightness between 230 and 250 nits. I would consider this screen as being mostly for indoor use though, as I said, it is marginally usable outdoors on a sunny day provided you have ample shade. If used in a darker environment the screen is bright but does suffer from typical LCD uniformity problems (see the image of a blank screen attached to this review).\\n\\nThe refresh rate of the display seems to be locked at 59Hz. Being an IPS screen it has very fast switching so it passed the blur-busters tests just fine - motion blur is all but non-existent making it great for watching video.\\n\\nThe capacitive touch screen is very responsive and feels accurate even with my giant fingers. I don\\'t have a stylus to test so I can\\'t comment on compatibility or accuracy of that.\\n\\nReal-Life Windows 10 (Not S Mode!)\\nA lot of this 2-in-1 style of laptop come with an operating system called “Windows 10 Home in S Mode”. “S Mode” is a highly limited implementation of Windows 10 that only allows you to use the Edge browser and only allows you to run software from the Microsoft App Store. The inclusion of “S Mode” rather than a real-life Windows 10 is usually an indication that the vendor was not confident that the hardware provided would actually be able to run Windows 10. Thankfully this laptop comes with a fully enabled implementation of Windows 10 Home and in my testing it performed just fine.\\n\\nIncluded Software\\nWhat would setting up a new machine be without going through and removing all of the pre-loaded garbage vendors always like to cram in? This machine comes with a pretty standard complement of bloatware, “free trial” and offer software. In case those terms don\\'t mean anything to you, it basically referrs to apps that are more about getting you on the hook for paying fees for services than they are about increasing your productivity.\\n\\nSome of the trialware/offerware is built in to Windows 10 itself, some of it comes from HP. I can\\'t really provide a comprehensive list of what I think you should immediately remove from this laptop upon powering it up, but I will recommend two that you should immediately get rid of. First is McAfee LiveSafe which is a waste of space that will soak up resources without actually protecting your computer then expire in a year or six months or whenever and beg for more money. Just uninstall it and reboot – your machine will automatically switch to the built-in Windows Defender anti-malware which is free with Windows, won\\'t kill your battery and actually does a much better job stopping and cleaning malware. The second thing I recommend you immediately get rid of is “WildTangent Games”. You\\'ll need to remove both the “App” and the installed program to get rid of it entirely. I\\'m deeply disappointed that HP thinks so little of its customers that it would ship this machine with WildTangent Games pre-installed. During my days as a PC tech WildTangent Games were a universally despised vehicle for spyware.\\n\\nThere were quite a few other things I removed right away like Express VPN, Dropbox Offer, Microsoft Office etc... If you don\\'t remove these they will periodically pop up and annoy you by either trying to talk you or scare you into signing up for new services. If you want cloud-based backup signing up for a Microsoft Account gets you some free “OneDrive” space and if you need more it\\'s worth paying for it – you don\\'t need both Dropbox and OneDrive. The Microsoft Office stuff gives you minimal access to Microsoft Word and tries to get you to sign up for paid services to get the rest. I switched to OpenOffice years ago and have never looked back. If you need a VPN service and don\\'t already have one, I suggest you shop around a little rather than just go for Express VPN. But I digress. I strongly recommend you go through the installed “Apps” and remove anything that says “Offer” next to it.\\n\\nConvertible / 2-in-1 features\\nThe ability to use the “convertible” features was the thing that most attracted me to this machine. I enjoy watching movies without having to be tethered to any particular room (and when traveling)\\n\\nLaptop Mode\\nIn laptop mode this is just like any other slim-line laptop. This configuration offers the best/clearest sound as the speakers fire up from the far side of the keyboard, and the best overall ergonomics.\\n\\nTent Mode\\nIn Tent Mode the laptop is folded into an upside-down V shape and propped up on a surface. This is by far my favorite mode for watching movies and TV with this machine, but it does come with extra considerations. In this mode the speakers are pointed away from you, though in my testing I was still able to hear things just fine. It would have been nice if they had included some silicone or rubber bumpers on the edge to keep the laptop from slipping or to keep rough surfaces from scuffing up the edge of laptop itself.\\n\\nTablet Mode\\nTablet mode is a bit of a mixed bag. Essentially you fold the laptop closed backwards with the keyboard and screen on the outside. The keyboard is disabled in this mode. While you can use this laptop sort of like you would a tablet, its extra bulk is a definite factor. The larger difficulty I had, however, was in holding it in a way that did not result in accidentally activating some control or scrolling to the bottom of a page because my fingers tickled the edge of the touch screen. Switching to \"Tablet Mode\" in Windows 10 did very little to alleviate this. Also in tablet mode it\\'s difficult to adjust the screen brightness or volume. I think this mode would be much better if they would provide volume and brightness controls on the edge of the machine and some software adjustment to move controls away from the edges where you\\'re likely to accidently activate them while just trying to hold the \"tablet\" in place.\\n\\nSpeakers\\nMuch is made of the \"Audio by Bang and Olufsen\". For such small speakers they do sound remarkably clear and present a wider dynamic range than I would expect, but that being said don\\'t expect miracles. I had to max out the volume in a couple of instances while watching shows in tent mode and even then it did not sound particularly loud.\\n\\nBattery Life\\nWithout trying to apply any scientific process to judge battery life, I noted while using it that I was able to get about 4-5 hours out of a charge when just browsing the web, watching the occasional YouTube video and writing in a word processor. It was only about 2.5 to 3 hours while watching Netflix or other videos at full brightness. At 3470mAh the capacity isn\\'t terribly impressive, but for such a lightweight system it seems just right.\\n\\nWiFi speed\\nThe multi-function Wi-Fi and Bluetooth in one chip provided with this laptop provides thoroughly average performance. In practice I was able to get transfer speeds of almost 10MB/s (Bytes not bits), which is more than enough for most day-to day activities, but doesn\\'t come close to the performance tuned chips in some of the other laptops I\\'ve reviewed, some of which were able to more than double that throughput. Again, I don\\'t consider this a drawback because it provides perfectly adequate performance for general purpose computing.\\n\\nWebcam / Microphone\\nThe built in webcam is very generic with a 720x1280 sensor. Like most generic webcams, it has a very low ISO sensitivity and therefore requires a decent amount of ambient light to show a clear picture. In a darker environment the image becomes grainy and video smears as the camera tries to compensate for low light. I wouldn\\'t try to record for YouTube on it, but it\\'s perfectly serviceable for web conferencing as long as you\\'re in a well-lit room.\\n\\nThe built-in microphone on the other hand actually sounds pretty good, picking up voice clean and clear. The documentation doesn\\'t say for sure, but it\\'s possible the mic was also designed by B&O. In any case I think they did a terrific job for a built-in mic.\\n\\nStorage\\nOne of the things I look for in a laptop is the ability to upgrade the primary storage. In general if you see \"eMMC\" listed on the description it means that the primary storage (i.e. hard drive) is soldered in and is generally more trouble than it\\'s worth to swap out. I\\'m happy to report that this laptop actually has full M.2 NVMe SSD which can, if the need arises, be replaced with a larger capacity drive, though the 512GB drive it ships with is plenty big for my needs. This laptop was clearly not designed to be upgraded or serviced by end users as evidenced by how annoying they made it to take apart, but once I had the back off it looks like it was designed to incorporate a full SATA SSD as well with a spot carved out under the right palm rest and an unpopulated ribbon socket labeled \"HDD1\". I could not find any documentation on this (as of the time of this review), so I\\'m not sure if it\\'s an either-or where you have to pick one or the other or if you can use both a SATA and M.2 drive at the same time. I was unable to test this because I don\\'t have the proprietary adapter to connect the drive to the board.\\n\\nThe supplied 512GB NVMe drive perfomed adequately but maxed out at ~1GB/s writes and ~1.5GB/s reads. This is somewhat normal for a budget drive but about half the potential of the NVMe spec. As it would have involved re-installing Windows 10, I did not wish to try out a faster NVMe drive to see if the limitation lies with the drive itself or the controller. Since you\\'re not going to be gaming on this laptop, the drive speeds are absolutely fine.\\n\\nCPU/GPU Performance / Throttling\\nSo does this laptop throttle the CPU? While my default is to assume that it throttles the CPU/GPU until proven otherwise, most of my attempts to verify one way or the other have been stymied by the unavailability of system hooks used by the Intel XTU (which flat out refuses to install) or MSI Afterburner (installs but can\\'t actually see anything). With a base frequency of 1GHz the machine runs pretty cool most of the time. The fan isn\\'t really capable of moving much heat so I seriously doubt that you will ever see a \"burst\" to 3.6GHz, but again unless you\\'re trying to game on this machine that\\'s largely immaterial.\\n\\nIn my testing what games I was able to get running ran reasonably well at medium to high settings - older games ran fine at high settings, newer ones needed to be dialed back. Even though this isn\\'t a gaming machine it\\'s a good indication of what its capable of.\\n\\nI had no trouble editing large images with GIMP, including computationally complex operations such as perspective shift and de-noise algorithms.\\n\\nThe full-sized HDMI port makes it easy to connect a second monitor up to 4k@60 (it will default to 4k@30, but can be switched to 60Hz and in my testing works without any issues). Likewise it was able to render web pages and video in 4K just as smoothly as it did in 1080p.\\n\\nGaming\\nThis isn\\'t a gaming laptop – which is probably obvious to anyone reading this, but even the most businesslike user may be tempted to dabble now and again. I had considerable trouble getting games to run reliably on this. Most titles crashed to desktop after one to five minutes without so much as a helpful error message. What I did have some luck with were older titles like BioShock, Deus Ex Human Revolution etc...\\n\\nWatching Video\\nFor video playback I tested a variety of scenarios. Playback of H265 10-bit 4K (HDMI Outputs 4K) content was basically smooth and flawless as was Blu-ray playback via VLC and libaacs. Both YouTube and Netflix had occasional stuttering on 1080p content but I\\'m being very nit-picky. If I was not paying specific attention to how smooth playback was I would probably not have noticed.\\n\\nMiscellaneous\\n- Unfortunately the 14-dh2011nr doesn\\'t support Power Delivery which means that it can\\'t be charged via the USB-C port like some of the higher-end x360\\'s can. In my opinion this is a huge missed opportunity as the ability to charge via USB-C makes it easier to purchase extra power adapters (one for home one for the office, etc...) and opens up the possibility of extending runtime while traveling by using a large power bank that supports PD.\\n- Had to use compatibility mode to get certain apps (OpenOffice) to properly scale fonts etc... This is generally caused by the display drivers not being full featured enough to support the DPI mode being set from the app.\\n- Like most laptop power adapters, there is no obvious way to wrap the cord to minimize the space it takes up inside your bag.\\n- The USB ports had no trouble delivering enough power to power external spinning hard drives and optical drives without needing to use a second power source. This also means that if you use this laptop\\'s ports to charge other devices over USB they may charge faster if the device is designed to take advantage of higher-amperage power sources.\\n\\nConclusion:\\n\\nThe 14-dh2011nr isn\\'t the most powerful, doesn\\'t have the brightest screen, isn\\'t the fastest, but it has all around great features and performance for this price range. It\\'s perfect for surfing the web, web conferencing, editing photos, and watching movies or shows. It\\'s one of the best priced 2-in-1 laptops I\\'ve seen that\\'s capable of running full-blown Windows 10 Home and doesn\\'t feel sluggish in the slightest. It\\'s quiet, has good battery life, lightweight and an all around pleasure to use. In short it\\'s exactly what I was looking for.\\n\\nPros:\\n- Lightweight and thin\\n- Full-sized standard keyboard (compatible with available keyboard covers)\\n- Full-sized HDMI socket - supports 4K@60 just fine\\n- Full Windows 10 Home (NOT \"S Mode\")\\n- Good battery life\\n- Convertable has great options for watching video or working without a keyboard\\n- Quiet fan - even going full blast it\\'s barely above a whisper\\n- Decent amount of storage - 512GB\\n- Legit M.2 drive (so it\\'s upgradeable)\\n- Great built-in mic\\n- The full-sized USB 3.0 ports deliver enough amperage to support power-hungry devices like external hard drives and external DVD/Blu-ray drives\\n\\nCons:\\n- Shiny reflective screen surface can be really distracting (mostly during dark scenes in videos)\\n- No \"bumpers\" or rubber feet to protect the edge and stop slipping in Tent Mode\\n- Screen is only around ~240 nits makes it only marginally usable in daylight - this is really an indoor screen\\n- Pre-loaded with bloatware/nagware software including the spyware \"WildTangent Games\"\\n\\nNeutral Observations:\\n- Can\\'t really game on it (newer titles seem to run okay but almost all of them crash out in the first minute)\\n- Tablet mode is novel but difficult to use because controls are on the edge where you\\'re holding your fingers\\n- The GPU is extremely basic and lacks any options for monitoring\\n- The CPU lacks the normal system hooks for monitoring',\n",

Can\\'t call this a good gaming laptop if the laptop can\\'t property handle the hardware.\\n\\nThis laptop has quite an impressive spec sheet for the price, but with some issues within an hour of unboxing, I\\'m not sure if the laptop will last.\\nThe laptop came out of the box without WiFi drivers, so I had to run to the store and grab an ethernet cable to finish setting it up online.

I\\'d say it\\'s a good price, but the hardware/software is abnormally horrible for a new PC. Only other grievance I\\'ve noticed so far is how hot it can get on the bottom of the PC. I know it has a dedicated graphics card in it, but coming from my previous PC (the Dell Inspiron 15 5000 5577), it never got too hot to touch & was very quiet.',\n",
       " 'It\\'s taken me a week or so to fully digest the functionality and pros/cons of this laptop. Overall, if you read the product description (and know anything about electronics) it\\'s pretty straight forward what you\\'re getting. That being said, I feel it\\'s important to outline a few cool features as well as drawbacks you may overlook.\\n\\nInitial Impression: Materially, this is a really solid piece of equipment. Though somewhat heavier than I expected, this is typical with a gaming laptop. The power adapter is massive however, and unnecessarily so. I don\\'t know if this has anything to do with requiring more energy for intense gaming, but it\\'s literally a quarter the size of the laptop itself. The keys are backlit (which can be turned on and off with the press of a button), and there are ports for virtually everything you could imagine. The screen itself is somewhat of a matte texture which is something I\\'m not used to, but after a few hours of use I appreciated how it prevents glare. As with most laptops, the brightness is adjustable on the keyboard - something to take into consideration when trying to preserve battery life. That being said, startup was a nightmare... but this was due largely in part to my internet being down - an essential requirement to get up and running. I\\'m very much a \"plug and play\" kind of guy, so you can imagine my frustration when the computer repeatedly froze on a black screen until I was able to get online to download essential updates and software components (all of which should be pre-installed for a device this new). Trying to add a secondary user was equally frustrating as it also needed to re-download many of the same components as my setup, once again freezing repeatedly. Once past all the initial turmoil, everything was a breeze.\\n\\nExtended use: After a full charge, the battery lasted roughly 2.5-3 hours while I browsed the internet and worked on documents. With streaming and game play, the battery life is surprisingly close to the same (roughly 2 hours depending how much multi-tasking you\\'re doing). The dual fan system is incredibly quiet and kept the laptop from heating more than say your average smartphone after prolonged use.\\n\\nCortana is your virtual assistant (similar to Siri). While she is accessible from your desktop, you can also enable \"Hey Cortana\" in the settings which will allow her to respond to voice commands.\\n\\nLink your phone using the edge app. This allows you to sync browsing history, favorites, and alternate seamlessly between devices (simply by logging into your Microsoft account). It is worth noting the functionality for Apple products is more limited than Android (which allows you to see/sync SMS, MMS, pictures, and video). I have an iPhone, so I cannot personally attest to whether or not the additional Android features actually work, but the information showed up while setting up my device.\\n\\nGame Shift, a function controlled by a button on your keyboard, is said to increase the fan speed to cool the processor, and prioritizes game data over annoying popups or background apps (and updates). Basically, it is supposed to optimize the resources needed during gaming (processor, video card, memory, etc). I attempted to test this function with several games and did not notice a difference or receive the on-screen prompt that it was working. Perhaps I need to update a driver for this? It wouldn\\'t surprise me given the number of essentials I had to install during setup. That being said, the gaming I did was pretty seamless and ran without issues.\\n\\nIt\\'s worth mentioning there is no CD/DVD drive. I completely overlooked this prior to ordering, and the vast majority of my software is on discs. This is easily resolvable with an external drive which costs virtually nothing nowadays.\\n\\nThe webcam has an indicator light next to it to ensure privacy (so you know when it\\'s on). The resolution is average, but consistent with other laptop cams on the market.\\n\\nLastly, a few quick notes. As an avid gamer and video editor, I will say one thing I found discouraging is the computer\\'s memory. Though this is something easily resolved with an external drive, all of these \"plug in\" devices begin to defeat the purpose and simplicity of a laptop. Additionally, the included manual indicates a fingerprint reader on/by the power button... this is NOT a standard feature with all G3 models.\\n\\nSummary: When utilized for office use (or basic functionality) this laptop is superior in terms of speed and software capabilities. For standard gaming it\\'s average, and for the professional gamer it might be underwhelming in some of the areas outlined above. Still, when put to the test it\\'s a reliable laptop that I\\'d consider a nice addition to Dell\\'s product line.',\n",

If you are holding W to move, A or D to strafe, and maybe holding CTRL to crouch you cannot do any other command.

Or playing a MMO I may be holding WD to strafe move. and need to hold SHIFT and press 1 to use a ability and it wont register because its to many keys at once.

I wish it could be lowered a bit more and it would be great if retractable arm rests could be added some how (for elbows/arms to rest on as you type, otherwise the angle of the wrists causes repetitive stress fatigue after a typing a while). And seriously, it is perfect as a little lap desk for kids doing their homework or drawingor eating snacks while watching their cartoons.',\n",
       " \"The product itself is amazing and the packaging/presentation is also great! The screens are a little small but they are efficient and get the job done. Picture quality is also up to par unless you're gaming. The brightness is okay; definitely not the same as your laptop screen. It seems to make the display more fluorescent than it does bright when you try increase the brightness which is kind of hard on the eyes but it also performs its basic function. The only thing I really have to complain about is that the display won't work unless it's hooked up to an HDMI cable. I'm someone who moves around/travels around a lot for work so I bought a slimmer laptop that only has 1 HDMI port. While the product is great, I can only use one of the two screens I paid for unless I pay for a HDMI splitter. It would be nice to have the option to hook the monitor display up via C port which didn't work when I tried it, especially for the price I paid for it. That being said, I don't own a USB to USB cable so haven't tried doing it that way and will update this review once I do. (It would also be nice to include that cable in the box since it seems to come with every other one but that one) All in all, still an excellent purchase.\",\n",
       " 'I saw reviews saying you need 2 HDMI ports and thats not true. I got 2 screens, I set one of them up using a usb-c to usb-a cable and and HDMI cable and the other screen is using only a USB-C to USB-C cable and they both work. The weird thing you have to do is unplug and replug the cables for some reason the signals get confused but eventually they work if you just keep unplugging and replugging. Once it works, it stays working. The screens have many picture settings.\\n\\nThis model is much better than the magnet models, this model hugs the perimeter of your laptop screen so it cant fall down. The only thing to not is that yes there is a lot of weight on your screen so if you tip the screen forward of backward too much it will topple over, but I adapted to this fairly quickly and just made sure not to let it topple over thats all. The technology is not perfect yet, they need to devise some sort of kickstand on the sides to prevent the toppling, but until then, this is the best you are gonna get. It solved a problem for me so I gave it 5 stars.',\n",
       " \"A welcome addition to my old laptop. Before the pandemic I worked at a 4 display workstation. I didn't realize how spoiled I had become with all that screen real estate until I had to start working from home on a company laptop. Now I can multi-task again with ease.\\nI have to say this was extremely well packaged. Plenty of foam rubber padding to protect it from any shipping mishaps. It comes with plenty of cables to hook it up for most configurations and a handy velour bag for storing it in.\\nSetup was quick and painless and could be accomplished by even the most technologically challenged user.\\nThe only con was due to my older model laptop which required a USB to hdmi adapter. However I knew this in advance as it is clearly stated in product information.\\nDefinitely would recommend this to anyone in a similar position.\",\n",
       " \"After looking online for options, this one seemed to have the better mounting options. I can feel confident that the monitors secure very well to the main monitor. Though it hasn't been a problem for me, I can see where a kickstand should have been a part of the design. I am using these on a 15.1 laptop, so they are a little smaller than I'd like, but the screens have a scale option that helps. I typically stage my teams on one and outlook on the other, so I can use my main screen for real-time work.\\nThere are a couple of features that would improve this greatly:\\n1) larger screen options\\n2) Kickstands. The only reason I don't have troubles is because I have mine attached to a bigger laptop, if it was mounted to anything smaller, I could see this being a big problem.\\n3) Rotating screens so that they can be better protected and stay on the laptop during transport, having to mount/unmount every time it is used almost defeats the purpose of having.\\n4) Better cable options! The monitors are powered through their usb c ports- and possibly the usb 3.0 at bottom. Given the variety of laptops that this is able to support, it is hard to see this improving. I’m hoping that I can eliminate two cables for 1 via a laptop dp to monitor usb c. These are ideal for a user with two c ports, which I sadly do not have.\\n5) Portability. In general, this applies to all of the above. I think the designer tried to maximize the ability to adapt to a range of laptop sizes and sort of ignore the problems of leaving the unit attached during transit. This is a mistake. No one wants to constantly remove/attach these monitors and have to lug around numerous cable options. I do realize that improving on this is tricky since it could box them out of specific monitor sizes/ports/etc, but it’d be better to fill that gap sooner rather than later since once the laptop manufacturers catch on to this, it’ll be a factory-of-origin feature anyhow. I’ve seen competitor designs that account for this better, but they sacrifice on the mounting solution front, however they also include kickstands. I have yet to see one that covers all flawlessly, unfortunately.\\nOverall- a good buy. Buyers- know your laptop before buying. Make sure that your laptop can support 3 display inputs.\",\n",

       " 'It works fairly well, but if you have a Macbook Pro with only two (USB-C/thunderbolt) ports you will want to get an external hub with an HDMI connector that also allows pass-through AC power to the Macbook. That way you can connect one monitor to a USB-C port on the Macbook, and the other monitor to the external HDMI port on the hub and to an external power source. You don\\'t have to do this, you can run the monitors with the two built-in USB-C ports on the Mac and it works well, but that takes up both your ports and means you can\\'t run AC power to the Macbook and have to go off the battery, and the monitors will drain the battery very quickly, probably in an hour or so.

       " 'I want to point out ive only had it a week and will update if anything changes about my review. Overall, before I get into details, I am very satisfied with this laptop and it’s performance.\\n\\nThe pricing as what I bought was 1418.99$ for the intel i7-10750H with the rtx 3060 and 500G m.2. The availability of laptops has been pretty bad and I feel I wasn’t overcharged for the current market.\\nPros:\\nRtx 3060 is a little better than imagined. It is the 80W variant but will turbo up to 100W with spikes over 115W very well.\\nThe turbo button above the keyboard is actually more useful than I would have expected. In cyberpunk at max settings with medium ray tracing it’s an easily playable 55 FPS and turbo activated averages around 5fps or more higher even in the worst areas.\\nTemperatures at first freaked me out cause I saw spikes over 90C. But I found it was only temporary and the average with a decent fan curve was around 69 to 75C on both cpu and gpu.\\nPredator sense software built in is useful. But I still downloaded MSI afterburner for in game over lay though.\\nCons:\\nFans get pretty loud when you activate turbo. So if you got a decent headset and nobody around you it won’t bother you. But if your around people they will think you have a jet engine running. But even without turbo mode you get more than playable frame-rates in every game I’ve played. Most newer titles like cyberpunk and Valhalla\\nBattery is whatever. It’s maybe an hr usage if you’re playing heavy games and 7 hrs if you keep power saver mode on and only use it for light work like google chrome or YouTube.\\n\\nOther aspects:\\nScreen was nothing special. Not super bright but not excessively dark or glare issues. Keyboard is fine. Again, nothing special. It’s a laptop. Bloatware wasn’t too bad. Just uninstalled it all. But overall it is a quick responsive little laptop for easy gaming and even can do some work. I’m very satisfied because I’m a trucker on the road everyday and needed something a little more portable but still had performance to play the newer games without going to a 2 grand or more computer. I would recommend it to others.\\n\\nEdit: I forgot to say the pictures are without turbo and with turbo on 3D mark timespy score.',\n",

But it\\'s actually really good for the price, it definitely does have some limitations related to performance, but for for $250, I think this is a nice laptop for web browsing and simple applications. This is not for gaming or CPU intensive tasks, it can basically do what chromebooks can do, but with the advantage of being able to run windows apps from the Microsoft store and from the web. You have to turn off \"S Mode\", to be able to install apps from the web, but it\\'s really simple and it will prompt you, the first time you try to run an .exe file.\\n\\nThe exterior is really modern looking and has a light blue color, which gives the laptop a unique and refreshing look to it. The screen is your basic 1366x768 LCD panel, the cheaper TN kind of display that you will find on almost all laptops that cost less than $400. It doesn\\'t have the best viewing angles and the colors shift when you are too far off axis of looking at it from a 90 degree angle. It\\'s not all that vibrant or pretty, but to be honest, this is the kind of screen you get at this price point, it is what it is. Webcam is also your run of the mill, 640x480 (0.3 Megapixel), potato camera. This is actually slightly lower resolution than a typical webcam which are usually 1280x720. At least there is a nice bright LED to indicate that the camera is being accessed, this is a good privacy feature. The keyboard is above average for this price, I actually like it. Typing on it isn\\'t bad at all, the white letters against the black keys make it pretty easy to see in low light. The trackpad is made from plastic, but it is a nice size and is smooth to scroll on and easy to click. It\\'s programmed with the standard gestures used in Windows 10. I have seen worse trackpads on more expensive laptops. The screen can tilt way back on this, I really like this feature, it won\\'t go all the way around like a 2 in 1, but farther than a lot of laptops.\\n\\nThe internal specs are kind of ruff to be honest, but I\\'m trying to remind myself that for the price, this is about average. Intel Celeron N4020, this is a dual core CPU that is pretty much an entry level processor. It\\'s not very fast, but it will do what it needs to do for anything you do on the web using a browser, as well as handling simple applications like Microsoft word or playing videos locally using a media player like VLC. It shouldn\\'t have too much of a problem with Zoom or Skype calls. This laptop doesn\\'t have a fan, so it\\'s passively cooled. Playing games like Fortnight or Warzone is just not gonna be possible for this laptop. It only has 4GB of RAM, and 64GB of storage (half of which is already taken up by Windows). There is no way to upgrade the storage or anything else here, the way it comes out of the box is what you are stuck with. But as long as you just need a laptop for basic, everyday tasks, then this computer will be fine for that. I normally use a laptop with a quad-core i7 from 2020, and this laptop doesn\\'t feel that much slower for loading webpages or launching apps. I noticed that windows updates aren\\'t as fast, but that\\'s probably because the storage is eMMC based instead of NVMe (SSD). I recommend getting an external SSD, or at least a USB flash drive, to have more storage for files and apps. It has a Micro SD slot too, but I would advise you to use what I mentioned instead of a Micro SD card, because it will be a lot faster using the USB ports. The USB ports are 3.2 gen 1 (formerly known as 3.0), so they can transfer data at up to 5 Gigabits per second. This is much faster than the Micro SD slot will be (assuming you are using an external SSD). If you are only gonna buy a flash drive, then there won\\'t be much of an advantage over using Micro SD cards. There is also an HDMI port if you want to connect an additional monitor, or just use a larger one.\\n\\nThis laptop isn\\'t a powerhouse, and it lacks a lot of the bells and whistles you would get on a premium laptop. But not everyone needs the extra power and high end features. This is a good laptop that will serve you well, as long as you understand what it\\'s intended for. There are plenty of laptops our there that cost more than this and offer the same thing or even less, I think this Lenovo Ideapad 1 is a good value for the money. It\\'s modern looking with smaller sized bezels around the screen and has a good keyboard.\\n\\nPros+\\n\\nNice modern looking design with cool blue color\\n\\nAffordable\\n\\nGood keyboard and trackpad\\n\\nThin, lightweight, and quiet\\n\\nDecent battery life (6-8 hours)\\n\\nDecent port selection (2x USB A@5Gbps, Micro SD, HDMI, 3.5mm Aux jack)\\n\\nIncludes $80 of extra value, Microsoft 365 personal subscription for 12 months (can be added to 5 devices)\\n\\nCons-\\n\\nCeleron 4020 paired with 4GB of RAM limits what you can do with this laptop\\n\\nNo way to upgrade the RAM or Storage\\n\\nOnly 64GB of eMMC storage',\n",

       " 'For those who have been around computers for a while a topic usually comes up about Lenovo actually being IBM, and hence there is some sort of association of a certain prestige of quality in their minds. The discussion could go on for days but the simple answer is that they are not the same company, but when the focus shifts to opinions, my opinion is that over the years Lenovo has remained one of the better names associated with laptop computers. Remember, I say this as an opinion, there is no real world way to back such statements up by anybody. Like other prestige brand names that usually means you can expect to pay a little more for this one than a no name product. That’s why what I just said becomes important because it leads to another personal opinion that this particular product is overpriced for the technology it delivers and that makes me wonder who would buy it and why. The biggest limitation is that the operation system is the S version of Windows and if I’m paying this much I don’t want the limitations associated with this version. The alone puts me on the edge whether I would recommend it to someone else. That’s not the only limitation – unfortunately these days Windows-compatible software is still as bloated as it ever was back twenty years ago or so and a 64GB SSD attached to the mainboard is painfully small. The other specs aren’t that impressive either, but let’s say they are at least adequate. You can’t upgrade or add any additional memory either. I feel limited in a similar way by the permanently installed battery. I know that’s common on phones and tablets but this is a laptop and as such I expect more connectivity, more upgradeability and more configurability, at least at this price point.\\n\\nWINDOWS S LIMITATIONS\\n\\nI’m not going to dwell on the complicated topic of what the pros and cons are of Windows S, there are countless articles available online to give you the information you need. To me it boils down mostly to the fact that you can only use apps that you get from the Microsoft store. Yes there are thousands of them and for a large segment of users that would never be an issue but if there are apps, even one of them, that are unique and not available in the store, or if your work or play requires using a browser other than Edge – which is the only one you can use - that can make owning this laptop useless.\\n\\nDEALBREAKERS OR NOT\\n\\nIf you’ve read to this point, don’t stop now, you need to know why everything I’ve talked about so far aren’t ironclad deal breakers, there is still a lot in the plus column going for this laptop, let’s list them. I’m going to assume that the person who buys this item knows and understands that this is geared more toward someone who is going to use it for internet, email, and word processing than as a graphics workstation or for rugged road warrior use. That puts the focus on things like how good the keyboard is and how good the screen is and in true Lenovo fashion both are industry leaders. The keyboard is probably the best of any laptop in its class, the shape and arrangement of the keys embarrass many other brands. The keys have a good snap to them with a real keyboard keystroke travel that writers can appreciate. They are nicely sized and arranged for touch typing and top the list of reasons to consider this model. If you are a writer, as I am, and are looking for a lightweight travel companion laptop, put this model on your short list to consider. The screen also is better than I expected for the price. It’s not a great screen but for the tasks I’m describing it is sharp, clear, bright and usable. As far as sound, laptop makers always seem to be trying to put lipstick on it with impressive sounding words and names but in reality we’re still talking about a couple of speakers about the size of your thumbnail that aren’t going to shake, rattle and roll your room but they are fine for video conferencing and most everyday light duty tasks. The camera though is a major disappointment, is it even possible that anyone makes 640 x 480 cameras anymore – even the cheapest toy cell phones are at least 1.3 megapixel. I am more than disappointed how bad the camera is.\\n\\nConnectivity is also at a bare minimum, with only two USB ports and one HDMI port and a multifunction audio in and out connection.\\n\\nBUILD QUALITY\\n\\nThis is another area where my expectations are high, in fact to me the whole word ThinkPad itself translates to road warrior ruggedness, back in the day with IBM owned that trademark that is why companies and individuals paid top dollar for them, they were as close to bulletproof as our reasonable budgets could afford. My very first impression of this model is that is carries the tradition fairly well, I say fairly well because as soon as I touched it the top of the case snapped into place, it came off the assembly line that way and no one bothered to check it or snap it fully into place, but overall it feels a notch better than the other brands in this price range. But it should, they’re asking me to pay more for that trademark name so I expect them to deliver. I think customers who have used other low priced laptops won’t be disappointed.\\n\\nOne more thing you may want to consider is that while this is a thin and lightweight laptop, it is not a class leader in either – I have used several that excel in both specs. I think that falls into the category of personal preference though so I won’t count it as a pro or a con.\\n\\nSUPPORT\\n\\nThere are no guarantees that any company will be around tomorrow after our world has been almost turned upside down recently, but if I had to pick I would say Lenovo has a better chance than most. That’s all I can say about support that means anything, every case is different and my experience is meaningless to you. I recommend not making support a deciding topic to buy or not buy this product based on someone else’s opinion.\\n\\nSUMMARY\\n\\nEverything I know tells me that there is nothing major that should be a barrier to considering this model if your budget allows. It all depends on what you need it for. You really can’t save enough by going with a no name brand to make such penny pinching worthwhile and if you can pay a little bit more I recommend you make sure the memory is upgradable and that you can replace the battery if it needs it. That will probably cost you a hundred to two-hundred more but would be money well spent. My recommendation is to define your needs and then buy it and try it from a place with a good return policy. To sum it all up, this laptop could be just what someone with basic needs is looking for, and I keep coming back to if I was that person I strongly would consider buying one of the last few major brands than a no name product.',\n",

       " ' Acer Aspire 5 - RYZEN 7\\n.\\nThis model was probably the highest priced and the most expensive amongst the other 2 ones that were reviewed. I got it trusting the reviews and saw nothing bad was written about it though only 3 reviews were present.\\n.\\nNow obviously I’m writing this now, after day 2 of using it, rather then month 6 of wear and tear. So far so good. That response should be expected when trying anything new for a short period of time.\\n.\\n.\\n.\\nIssue 1: The speakers sometimes don’t sync with my video or sorta “black out” for a second. But it also just so happens that the computer gets really hot when that happens. So I mean, maybe if it stayed cooler the speakers wouldn’t fade for seconds at a time. I also ran it for about a full day, so a reset and some cool down time helped.\\n.\\nIssue 2: That being said, have something to cool it with. This computer could legitimately burn you it gets so warm. Not the end of the work though, all of my other computers have done that, I’m pretty sure that’s normal unless you have a high-tech device with a built-in fan. So please be wary of that.\\n.\\nIssue 3: The HD camera is 100% HD. I used it for other apps, but what’s seen in my little Zoom camera, the HD is non-exsistent. IDC though because it’s HD where and when it needs to be so :)\\n.\\nIssue 4: The SSD available is about 475 instead of the 500-ish. A little disappointed about that, but all I PERSONALLY needed was 256GB, so I can’t complain at all honestly. But anyone who wanted what they paid for? I’d be wary. I literally searched it’s system preferences the “technical” way by using the hidden commands to find those specific details. The computer blatantly states that all 512 is nowhere to be found, but 475 is. And even of that, about 23GB are already being used. Again though, I don’t really care. Peep the photo to see what I mean.\\n.\\nIssue 5: The RAM’s actually 5-ish GB, not 8. I think that’s a given with any computer, but I’m no tech expert. So I thought I’d key that in. I didn’t do a thorough check on my last computer, but I think my last one was about 6 or 7 of the 8. They both run pretty equivalent despite the major differences. Not sure if upgrading the RAM will start to show it’s superior quality, or if maybe it’s still being broken in for the first week. Who knows.\\n.\\n.\\n.\\nHighlight 1: Backlit. I don’t know why no computer seems to like back lit keyboards, but that’s genuinely something I would turn down a perfectly good computer for. I wan’a be able to work in poor lighting conditions. That said though... I can figure out how to keep the back lit on :( It’ll turn off after awhile.\\n.\\nHighlight 2: The screen quality is SOOOO nice I was shocked. I must’ve thought they were lying or something when they mentioned the high screen resolution because I was astonished at what I saw.. Absolutely beautiful.\\n.\\nHighlight 3: Though it’s not necessarily faster then my original laptop, that might just be my wifi. I thought the 7 would be a drastic improvement in processing speed and whatever else I read the expert’s write, but I can’t tell. Again though, it’s available storage and RAM is not optimal either so maybe that’s change if I upgrade those? Really, really not bad at all though! It runs AutoCad, Rhino, and other heavy, heavy applications with little issue! It’s also excellent at multitasking thus far, minor issues considered. I can’t speak for gaming, but I’d like to imagine that those programs are definitely for higher functioning computers- nothing a mac could handle :)\\n.\\nHighlight 4: All its parts and pieces where in order upon receiving it. I’m pretty sure I ordered brand new(I know that’s so bad of me to not remember). If I didn’t for whatever reason, the packaging and computer has like- no sign of use prior. Even it’s battery life, which is usually a very good indicator of used or new, shows no tampering. If you aren’t aware of what that little trick it, try it on your phone! So for Apple for example, you have the battery life- I’m on 82% right now.\\n\\nThen, inside settings < Battery < Batter Health, you’ll notice that it’s not 100%. Mine’s 90%. Meaning that as I’ve used it, it’s maximum capacity has gone down. Basically stating the battery has had wear to it. As it continues to decrease, the phone may shut down at 3% instead of 0%, or take 10 minutes instead of 5 to recharge from 0%. Things like that.\\n\\nI’m not entirely sure if I found it in the right place, but I didn’t see anything stating the battery’s life was diminished, so surely its as new as promised!\\n.\\nHighlight 5: I saw some reviews on the Ryzen 3 talk about a crappy mic and camera, which scared me for the 7, but so far both are excellent quality. Works really really well. The sound is also excellent. If it doesn’t sound good, either something is faulty- OR it’s on MONO. Mono is a sin IDC and it makes the laptop sound like poor quality looks. Please do yourself a favor and fix that in settings.\\n.\\nHighlight 6: Battery life’s pretty cool. I mean, I didn’t formally test it, but I can’t complain from what I’ve seen.\\n.\\n.\\n.\\nAll in all, I’m super excited to see what months are to come. My best laptop was actually a Mac and it ran me for about 4 years, probably longer if I hadn’t passed it down to my mentee. My last one was an HP and it absolutely fell apart when I dropped it accidentally back in early May. That one would’ve lasted me about a year. Some people have Laptops for a few months, others 10 years. I guess I’ll see. Oh, and obviously, for the price I’d like to believe this is pretty darn great so far.\\n\\nI’d recommend it. Just be sure to 100% check all its features before you start gettin’ all attached- that way issue or bugs can be caught immediately, reported, and replaced. Take photos and videos too between the unboxing to any unexpected errors; cover all your bases :)',\n",

Once you identify the RAM you want to replace the current stick with, it was fairly easy to install and upgrade. I purchased a Crucial Ram stick from their website. 2 DDR4 8 gig sticks for a total of 16 GB ram made the computer alot more useful, and less laggy. I like to listen to music or have multiple apps/tabs open sometimes so the RAM upgrade was a must for me. 4 out of 5 stars just because the little amount of RAM it comes with. Other than that, this was an awesome computer for the price. I can play video games casually (I use low quality settings though), and I can do all other basic functions like photoshop, web browsing, and office work/homework without a problem. And with the additional RAM listening to music while doing so is not a problem.',\n",

       " 'I was searching for a new laptop with a 3:2 ratio screen at a 14\" size, but didn\\'t want to spend $1,000. I discovered that 3:2 ratio screen sized laptops are hard to come by at a reasonable price. I ran into an article on a Chuwi laptop that used an Intel i3 processor on a website search, but had never heard of the brand. The site directed me to Amazon and I discovered an upgraded version, the Corebook X. This laptop uses an Intel i5, albeit one that is a few generations old. Nevertheless, I thought I\\'d give it a try since it also has a 3:2 ratio 14\" screen.\\n\\nI must say, I\\'m quite impressed with this laptop. Build quality is excellent, the screen is vivid with good contrast and color accuracy. It is thin and light but rugged as it is encased in metal. No screen flex and the keyboard is superb. The i5 processor is speedy as applications and websites snap open instantly, with no lag whatsoever. The m.2 SSD is a real plus, and an easily accessible door on the bottom provides a slot for adding an additional one.\\n\\nThe good stuff:\\n- The 3:2 ratio screen in a 14\" laptop hits the sweet spot for me. It provides excellent screen real estate and reduces constant scrolling. Not a gamer\\'s screen, but for business use it is excellent. Videos are amazing, albeit with a 1/2\" black bar above and below. Not a big deal for me.\\n- The i5 processor, 16gb of ram, and 256gb m.2 SSD put this laptop over the edge almost into premium category. And, the ability to easily add a second SSD is a real plus.\\n- Sturdy, all-metal case with a flat finish that resists fingerprints.\\n- The 3:2 screen size lengthens the laptop that allows for a HUGE trackpad that is smooth and responsive. And, it\\'s centered!!!\\n- Keyboard layout and feel are excellent. No misfires when using it. I really appreciate that it\\'s backlit, and is only on when using the keys.\\n- Plain old Windows 10 Home without bloatware of any kind! Thank you Chuwi!!!!\\n- All driver updates were accomplished through Windows update. No need to go to the manufacturers\\' website to get updates.\\n- Strong wifi connection using an Intel wifi radio.\\n- No screen ghosting like I\\'ve experienced on other laptops.\\n- I use Samsung dex on my Galaxy s10e, and it\\'s plug-and-play on this laptop through the USB-C port. No docking station needed. It immediately identified the Samsung dex functionality of my phone and downloaded the apps and drivers instantly.\\n- Fairly fast battery recharging time up to about 90% in 2-hours from 10%.\\n- I emailed a question about the laptop to Chuwi and they responded almost immediately! Excellent customer service.\\n\\nNot so much:\\n- Battery life is just OK. It uses a 43 amp-hour battery that is smaller than my 55 amp-hour Dell XPS 12 that I purchased in 2013, but gets about the same usage time. Not bad, but the Dell isn\\'t all that great either. However, the Chuwi does have a larger and brighter screen, so there\\'s that. So far, I get about 4-5 hours with constant use including heavy web access. That\\'s about exactly what Chuwi\\'s website proclaims, so no exaggeration there.\\n- The two speakers on the bottom are weak and sound tinny.\\n- A little stingy on ports. Only one USB-3 and one USB-C. There is a micro-SD slot, but I don\\'t foresee a need for that myself. It may be useful to someone who transfers a lot of photos and files to other devices without using the USB port.\\n- The power supply connector seems a bit weak. It appears that it could be easily damaged with a sudden tug on the cable. I would have preferred a magnetic connector to avoid any accidental problems.\\n-There is no light to indicate the laptop is in standby mode when the lid is closed. Also, just like with most other laptops currently, there is no light to indicate the drive is being accessed.\\n- Opening the lid takes a bit of getting used to unless one has long fingernails.\\n- Uses an older Intel processor that was released in 2017 and the m.2 SSD is not NVME. This is not an impediment to it\\'s overall performance and probably helps keep its price down.\\n- Uses a glossy screen, which is good news; bad news. It provides a sharp picture, but highly reflective under certain lighting conditions.\\n\\nOverall, I\\'m very pleased with this laptop. No quirkiness of any sort so far. Every other laptop I\\'ve purchased required further driver development to get rid of problems, including from Dell and HP.\\n\\nThis laptop takes full advantage of Windows 10 functionality and provides a superb user experience. It\\'s safe to say that with a little bigger battery this would be an exceptional laptop that could keep up with much more expensive models. I\\'ve only been using it for two days, so long-term use will be a critical factor. Nevertheless, I highly recommend it.',\n",

What I like about it is the unique hardware, such as the numpad mode integrated into the touchpad (it’s a clever use of space on a compact design), and the privacy sliding cover on the webcam. It also packs above average specs compared to other models I looked at in this price segment, including 6GB of RAM (more than the typical 4GB for budget laptops), a FHD display with pretty good viewing angles, and a decent processor (J3455 is quad core, and almost 2 times faster than the more common N3350 in benchmarks). Pretty good overall!\\n\\nPros:\\n- Laptop feels sturdy and well put together, closes magnetically, sharp angular design looks more expensive than expected. I also really like the blue color, sets it apart from the crowd.\\n- SSD storage is upgradable using M2 SATA slot, by removing the back cover\\n- Nice selection of I/O for a thin laptop, including 2 USB 3.0 ports & micro SD slot\\n- Keyboard feels responsive to type on, touchpad is also working well for me\\n- Display is matte instead of glossy, which doesn’t reflect too much light, helping it remain visible in most environments I tried it in.\\n- It’s a fanless (silent) computer, so there’s no noise in the background, and remains pretty cool during usage.\\n- Battery life is decent, getting me around 5-6 hours per charge on moderate settings (the performance of the processor can be adjusted under battery settings).\\n- Amount of RAM is sufficient for comfortable web browsing, including opening 10 tabs in the browser, or doing some multitasking.\\n- General system navigation felt snappy, probably due to the SSD (boot up times are also quite fast).\\n- Runs on full Windows 10 operating system, so can easily install other legacy programs (unlike with Chrome OS).\\n\\nCons:\\n- Ultimately still an energy efficient laptop, so might not be a replacement for a gaming machine. However, for all other regular tasks, it’s a great choice to carry around and use for entertainment & office work.\\n- As is the norm at this price point, the charging isn’t USB-C (nor is the keyboard backlit), but that’s to be expected. Still a solid device overall and a good Chromebook alternative!',\n",
       " ' I have been in need of a laptop for daily computing tasks for a while. My needs are fairly basic... mostly I needed something for working on spreadsheets and documents, browsing the internet a bit and streaming. This is a basic machine, at a reasonable price, that is able to perform the aforementioned tasks I need.\\n\\nThe N3350 is an entry level CPU with 1.1GHz base frequency and up to 2.4GHz burst. While low ranking on benchmark tests against other CPUs, it is still quite capable of doing what I need. They have it paired with a 128GB ssd for faster performance and 6GB of RAM. To further optimize the performance of the laptop it arrives running Windows in S mode. This is basically a Windows version of a Chromebook which optimizes the performance, keeping the familiar windows experience. In S-mode I am limited to apps from the windows store, but that is fine for my purposes. If one does want to switch to regular windows 10, that can be downloaded for free with this copy of Windows from the Microsoft store.\\n\\nThe battery life is quite acceptable at around 6-7 hours. One of the nice things about the N3350 CPU is its low power consumption for extended battery life. That low power consumption also makes it cool running, hence this laptop is able to operate without a fan. It is a nice feeling laptop to use because it doesn’t get hot and and is absolutely quiet running without a fan.\\n\\nI find that this laptop has good tactile feel to type on. The display is large, crisp and bright for a pleasant user experience. Another feature I like is the numpad option that is built into the touchpad. I do a lot of work with spreadsheets so that is pretty handy for me. It is turned on easily by touching the “slide” button on the left side of the trackpad and sliding down to the spreadsheet icon. When done using the numpad, the trackpad is turned back on by swiping up from the “slide” button. The keyboard does still have the traditional numlock option if one prefers. That is available through the function keys as well as other common controls such as volume. Regarding sound, I find it to be quite good from this laptop on its own. One does have the option to either use auxiliary or Bluetooth speakers or headphones if preferred. The camera quality is also good and even has face tracking and autofocus. When not in use, I really find the built in cover for the webcam unique and handy. I have never seen that before on a laptop and do use it for my peace of mind when not using the camera.\\n\\nSince most of the work that I do on this laptop is web based, having good internet connectivity is important to me. That was what I worried about most with the performance but it has been absolutely fine. I’m able to load my one drive documents quickly, browse the web and stream videos smoothly.\\n\\nOverall, I am quite happy with this laptop. It is lightweight and portable to go with me wherever I need to work. I find myself needing to be quite flexible with my working location these days with kids doing school from home. I now have the ability to comfortably do my work wherever I need, either plugged in or on battery power.',\n",

The fan does turn on sometimes when I'm not heavily using the laptop, but it doesn't stay on long and it's not very loud. I play workout videos on the laptop and am very pleased with sound and video quality.

       " 'I have been in the professional IT industry for over 18 years and tinker with technology all the time for both work and fun. I am an enthusiast through-and-through who likes to explore the latest in the industry. For this particular review of the HP Chromebook 14 (2021), my extensive experience with Android, Apple iOS, and Windows phones and tablets will lend a helping hand in understanding what this laptop may or may not be suitable for.\\n\\nWHAT IS A CHROMEBOOK?\\nIt is important to first and foremost understand that Chromebook is precisely that — a laptop (notebook) based on Google’s Chrome operating system (OS), software that allows you to use and interact with the hardware. It offers a minimalistic, web browser experience that is far different from Windows and MacOS, but may appear familiar to Android users.\\n\\nThis particular HP Chromebook offers the Google Play Store from which you can download apps, games, and consume books, music, and movies — just like a Samsung smartphone or Google TV device. It also offers apps from the Google Chrome Web Store that are very limited in functionality but can enhance the web browsing experience with extensions (plugins).\\n\\nChrome OS is today’s dominant computing system used within the Education market, an area that Microsoft had been trying to challenge with its failed Windows RT and Windows S-Mode efforts. Apple, too, trails behind Google’s Chromebook platform.\\n\\nIN SHORT: Chrome OS, which was launched in 2011, very much feels like an Android tablet slapped onto a laptop form factor. It does not offer a full PC/Mac experience and essentially is a (usually) low-cost/low-powered computer whose main interface is the Google Chrome web browser.\\n\\nApps you download will constantly remind you that Chrome OS was not made for use as a full-fledged desktop computer (like Windows and MacOS) — they will be running in skewed, often frustrating, user interfaces that do not take advantage of the mouse and keyboard. If you have used the Apple iPad and downloaded iPhone apps onto it (with black bars on both sides of the screen), that is exactly how the Google apps behave on this Chromebook.\\n\\nThe fact that this HP Chromebook does NOT have a touch screen will magnify the frustration further when trying to use those apps, such as Facebook, Facebook Messenger, and more. There are some apps that do take full advantage of the entire screen: Plex, Netflix, Chrome browser, Word, Excel, etc. But again, many of their interfaces are designed for the touch experience and not for a keyboard/mouse combination.\\n\\nNow that you know some of the main differences in user and software experience between a Chromebook and Windows/MacOS laptop, let us discuss what IS good about the HP Chromebook 14 (2021).\\n\\nPROS\\n- Light weight (3.25 lbs)\\n-- 12.8″ L x 8.6″ W x 0.7″ H\\n- Great, all-day battery life\\n- Pleasant, clean, simple hardware design\\n-- Minimalistic and simple for basic computing\\n-- Inexpensive, though competing Windows laptops may offer slightly more for the same price point\\n- Excellent for day-to-day web browsing and occasional Android app use\\n-- Brain of the computer, the Intel Celeron N4000 processor, is well-suited for this use case and provides low power usage\\n- 14″ HD display, though its 1366 x 768 pixel resolution puts it in the 720p HD territory, not the sharper 1080p\\n- Multiple apps and browser tabs performed well, though the 4GB of memory (RAM) will limit how much you can have running at once without negatively affecting overall performance\\n- Built-in, wide angle webcam that was good, but not quite flattering or sharp\\n- Dual microphones captured audio well for video conferences\\n- Access to a full suite of Google Play Store apps, games, music, movies, and books\\n-- Microsoft Office supported, albeit as limited web or Android app versions\\n- Google Play Store games performed adequately well\\n-- Graphics powered by the integrated Intel UHD 600 chip\\n- Extremely low risk of a virus taking over (but apps and Google Chrome browser extensions can still steal your data and more)\\n-- Commonly used for Google Classroom and the education market because its functionality can be limited with supported, administrative Google controls\\n- 32 GB of eMMC storage built in\\n-- Though this is generous for casual computing, you may quickly find yourself running out of space and needing to augment it with a microSD card\\n-- eMMC storage is very slow compared to SSD drives\\n- Storage expansion via microSD card slot\\n-- Tested to work fine with a SanDisk 128GB card\\n--- SanDisk and Kingston are the top SD card makers I recommend for their reliability. SanDisk Extreme offers lifetime warranty and is the series I, personally, always get\\n-- You should always make a backup of your important files)\\n- Support for running a subset of Linux\\n- Rechargeable with USB-C PD\\n- 2 USB-C PD and 1 USB-A ports\\n- Bluetooth and WiFi\\n- Bang Olufsen-tuned speakers were loud enough to enjoy a movie with in a quiet room, but did not wow me much\\n\\nCONS\\n- Subpar screen that is dim at times and not visible from all angles\\n-- Does not compare to the much more expensive Microsoft Surface (or even the lower cost Surface Go) display\\n- Frustrating keyboard with some missing keys, like “Delete”, Caps Lock (there’s a keyboard shortcut to turn it on/off), and more\\n- Requires a constant connection to the internet for most tasks and apps\\n-- If you are offline, only a subset of apps can still be used\\n-- Not quite suitable for taking on the road unless you are able to somehow stay online to the Internet\\n- Limited storage space, making you more reliant on Cloud storage services like Google Cloud, Microsoft OneDrive, Dropbox, Box\\n- Does not have full functionality like a Windows/MacOS computer, including seamless file server access, user account controls, and more\\n-- Windows/MacOS can do everything this Chromebook can, plus usually faster and more\\n-- Microsoft Office is available only as limited web or Android app versions. To gain full functionality, you will still need Windows or MacOS\\n-- Full-featured programs not available for Chromebook, like Adobe Lightroom, Photoshop, Premiere video editing, etc.\\n- May be too minimalistic or simple\\n-- Limited support for hardware. Not all devices you connect to a Chromebook will work, even if they function fine with Windows/MacOS\\n- Does not interact well with Windows/MacOS computers like file sharing\\n- Screen is not touch sensitive, making use of some apps and games frustrating or impossible to enjoy\\n- Screen not detachable for use as a standalone tablet (like Microsoft’s Surface or Surface Book)\\n- Frustrating, limited, or non-existent user account controls, like Parental Controls, especially if your Google account was created with Google Apps/Suite/G Suite/Workspace, or whatever Google decides to rebrand its services to\\n- Memory and internal “hard drive” space are not upgradeable\\n- Tinny sound with little bass\\n- Slow with switching between users\\n- No wired network port (RJ-45 Ethernet) for when WiFi is not available\\n\\nTIPS\\n- Push the Search button to start the “Launcher” (the equivalent to Windows’ Start button)\\n- Push Ctrl–Alt–/ (all 3 keys) to see a list of all available keyboard shortcuts\\n-- Search Google for “chromebook keyboard shortcuts” to see more\\n- Push Search+L to lock the screen\\n-- You can go to Settings and type “Pin” to set up a pin code instead of having to always type in your Google account password\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\nFor someone who values the flexibility of running full-fledged software and could more easily connect to computer-accessible services, Windows-based low cost laptops are a better choice for a power user like myself. For someone who wants simplicity and mostly does everything from a web browser, consumes media through apps, and wants more of an Android and/or Linux experience, a Chromebook like this HP is a great option.\\n\\nNonetheless, either choice will be excellent for use as a travel laptop for blogging, researching, and so on — but in the case of a Chromebook, you will not be able to use it much if you do not have Internet access. We will be using our Chromebook primarily for casual web surfing, media consumption, writing reviews like this, and partially unsupervised school work.',\n",
       " \"I'm a Mac guy for the most part. My main computer is an iMac, but I've always had a Windows laptop for use when travelling etc (too cheap to buy a Macbook....). My Windows laptop died at a time when I really needed one and I saw this and thought what the heck, I'll give it a try.\\n\\nI'm very pleased. For online use, it's absolutely fine. The screen resolution isn't up to my Mac, but my Windows laptop wasn't either. I don't really like that I'm logged on to Google (and being tracked) whenever I use it, but I don't do anything online that I'd be ashamed of so I guess that's OK.\\n\\nIt was a little bit tricky to get online for the first time, but that's pretty well documented out on the web, and it was easy to get beyond the issue. Not really anything to worry about.\\n\\nThe battery life is very good. Haven't used the camera, so I don't know about that. But it's lightweight and portable and runs plenty fast. I think it's a very good value.\",\n",
       " \"I'm going to write this review assuming you already know the difference between a Chromebook and Windows or MacOS, but in case you don't know, it's basically a laptop that runs Google Chrome and Android Apps with a little bit of storage and the ability to work offline too.\\n\\nSo I'm going to focus more on hardware, features and performance.\\n\\nFirst off, the build is really nice. It is mostly plastic, and nice and light, but feels really solid and the hinge is not floppy at all. The base is a silver metallic color while the outer shell is bright white. It seems to resist fingerprints fairly well. You have a full size keyboard and a large trackpad, and the base has long rubber feet to keep it from sliding around your desk. On the left, there is a 3.5mm headphone jack, USB-C port, and micro-SD slot. On the right is another USB-C port as well as a USB-A (full size) port. The laptop charges via either USB-C port. Webcam and built in mic up top.\\n\\nPerformance wise, everything runs well enough. You won't be blown away by the speed or the screen quality/refresh rate or anything like that, but performance is solid and hiccups and stutters are relatively few. You can have multiple tabs and several apps running without bogging it down too much. The screen looks good and sharp for the size and resolution. Colors are not super vivid but look good. Battery life is fantastic. Easily 8-10+ hours between charges which blows a lot of Windows laptops out of the water.\\n\\nA few standouts for me are the nice feel of the keyboard and the excellent speakers. First, the keyboard just feels good to use. It's not too loud and the key travel is about perfect. The speakers are situated on either side of the keyboard facing up! Many laptops these days have the speakers underneath or just internal. So audio out of these is quite good compared to even more expensive devices. Also honorable mention goes to the fan-less design. In other words, it runs completely silently since there is no cooling fan or spinning disk drives.\\n\\nA few drawbacks as well... the keyboard is not lit, which is just fine considering this is a budget device, but worth noting. Also, while I really like the large clicky trackpad, the thumb side of my palms rest on it when typing and it doesn't take much force to click it, so I sometimes get random clicks when typing. Not a huge deal, but it'd be nice if it was slightly stiffer.\\n\\nAlso not really a drawback but more of an observation, it does not have a dedicated google assistant button down by Alt and Control.\\n\\nIf you have a Google account and an Android phone, there are a lot of benefits to syncing them up. However you can obviously still use it even if your an iPhone user, it just won't sync with your messages and notifications. Android users can also use their phones to instantly unlock it and activate tethering.\\n\\nSo to wrap up I believe this is a nice, budget friendly laptop and will do the job if you just need something to browse the web, do some productivity work in the Google suite (docs, slides, sheets, etc.), and play around with. It doesn't have all the bells and whistles but isn't missing anything essential. It runs good and the battery lasts a long time, so I am happy with it and think most people will find it's a nice device to have.\",\n",
       " \"Right off the bat this is an ok Laptop as-is. Its got a great power frugal processor with integrated Vega graphics. Its downsides are its anemic RAM (4gb) and Tiny Hard drive. Thankfully both of these can be upgraded on the cheap to make this a real beast of a PC. Im going to tell you step by step how I took this three hundred dollar pc and made it faster, with more memory and hard drive space under a 100 bucks, including the drive cloning tools!!!\\n\\n1. Purchase 4gb-16gb single DIM laptop memory - I purchased a varisys 16gb ddr4 module for $46.00 here on amazon.\\n2. Purchase larger NVME m.2 drive - I purchased a samsung pro 960 512gb for $42 from amazon.\\n3. Purchase 2 NVME usb adapters - Sold here on amazon for $8/each\\n4. Download paragron drive clone software.\\n\\nNow before I go any further I will say that the biggest bang for the buck is going to be the RAM upgrade in which it is the simplest and easiest upgrade for this system, you will get the same performance with the stock hard drive as you would the upgraded one just at a much smaller 128gb size. With the low cost of external drives you may not want to even upgrade the hard drive and just stick with external media to save larger files.\\n\\nAfter acquiring all your components the first thing you're going to want to do is disassemble the rear of the acer computer. There are 11 phillips head screws on the underside of the laptop, once those are removed use a plastic tool like a spudge or even a toothpick to gentle pry up one side of the rear case until it unclicks, from there slowly go around and lift up the rest of it, once youve gotten about a quarter way through you can simply just use your hand to free the rest of it. Once removed you will see an open DIMM slot for a memory module (thats where out 16gb stick is going) and below that the already installed m.2 128gb Hard drive. Remove the phillips head screw from the m.2 drive and remove the drive itself from the computer. At this point insert the drive into one of the USB caddys you purchased from amazon and than take your new drive and insert that one in a caddy as well. From there take both loaded hard drive caddys and put them in another windows PC you have. Once thats done ensure that the computer is recognizing both drives and than install paragon software. Once installed run paragon and choose drive clone. From there set your source drive as the original m.2 drive you removed from the acer computer and your destination drive as the newly purchased NVME drive. Choose Sector by sector copy and click next. This process will go pretty quickly and will probably only take around 5-10 minutes depending on the computer youre using to clone the drives on. Once the drive is cloned, take the new nvme drive and insert it into the Acer notebook where the old one was removed. From there pop in your new memory module into the empty memory slot above. Once one make sure things are seated well and the m.2 drive is screwed back down. Once thats done put the back case back on the computer and gently push down the backing until it clicks back into place. Once done reattatch the screws until all are reinstalled. Flip her over, and fire her up! Verify that everything works and go about your way. However I would suggest turning off windows S mode and using Home instead as you can install third party apps.\\n\\nNow onto my clickbait title. The computer in the picture next to the acer is my m1 macbook pro with 1tb drive and 16gb ram. Without taxes it was $1,700 bucks. I have photoshop, lightstudio, propresent all installed on it. All of which are large memory and processor dependent hogs. On my acer I have the exact same programs installed. And guess what the acer loads them quicker, renders files faster, runs cooler, and is about a quarter of the price. Battery life is about as good as my macbook, acer with movies or web browsing is around 7-8 hours of battery life. And no joke but I am now using this acer as my primary travel computer for work and design in lieu of my macbook. I like the larger screen, better keyboard layout and less worry about breaking it as its a quarter of the price. The acer itself build quality is that of 1k+ pc's and has a nice metal desgin with minimal plastic. Keyboard isnt mushy and is quite tactile for a laptop. Screen is ok, could be brighter, but still very good. Processor is a beast and will deal with anything thrown at it. Light gaming can also be done on this machine, however this isnt intended for AAA titles. All in all this is one of the more surprising purchases Ive made recently that really blew me away in terms of performance for so little investment. For a grand total of 387 (including laptop) I have a machine that rivals PC laptops costing well over a grand and macs costing nearly 2 grand!!!\",\n",
       " 'I have been very satisfied with this purchase so far. I\\'ve only had it set up for less than a week, so I can\\'t really state how well the battery is going to be,,,but so far it is great. I have only had one small problem with setting up the email, but I\\'m just going on my web browser and accessing it from there, not sure what the problem is, probably something on my \"non-thechie\" side of the screen. It is a great value for the money and I have absolutely no complaints.\\nThe best feature I have found so far is the back lit keyboard....I had no idea how wonderful this would be....it\\'s great. I used to have to squint or turn on a light, but not anymore. It\\'s really an amazing little labptop and the screen is crystal clear. The speed is very fast and so far I am loving this laptop way more than the last 2 Hewlett Packards that I have had to replace due to faulty battery setting.\\nI love this computer.',\n",
       " 'Wow, I am impressed by this laptop. It has the best keyboard feel, display quality, and high-end look at this price point. This is a good choice IF you are ok with the small data storage space (or plan to upgrade).\\n\\n— The lighted keyboard feels like a keyboard from a premium $1,000 - $2,000 laptop. Very nice soft touch with excellent quiet tactile feedback.\\n\\n— I love the power switch button location as a key on the upper right of the keyboard. It is so much easier to find this key vs. fumbling around trying to find a power button on the side of the case.\\n\\n— The image quality on the display is excellent. This has a matte finish, not the super glossy finish which creates glare. I like the matte screen for all room lighting conditions and color accuracy. I am really impressed with the screen because at this low price I usually see terrible laptop screen resolution and quality. This one is an exception with the very nice Full HD IPS display.\\n\\n— This has the key extras, such as a webcam, fingerprint reader, and combination of USB 3 + C port types.\\n\\n— This comes with Windows S mode (limited apps for security) and it takes just a few seconds to click on the Microsoft Store and change Windows to regular mode.\\n\\n— There is minimal bloatware (unnecessary software preinstalled) which is nice, because that’s a common annoyance on new computers. I didn’t have to uninstall anything to get a clean, streamlined Windows 10.\\n\\nI recommend this laptop for two types of users:\\n\\n1. If you need something for basic web browsing, school or office work and you are ok with the tiny drive data storage capacity.\\n\\n2. If you are the kind of techie who likes to use your own memory + disk drive upgrade rather than the manufacturer provided components. This laptop is a great starting point for these upgrades.\\n\\nI am in category 2. I upgraded to Samsung (MZ-V8V1T0B/AM) 980 SSD 1TB - M.2 NVMe Interface Internal Solid State Drive with V-NAND Technology and Crucial RAM 16GB DDR4 2666 MHz CL19 Laptop Memory CT16G4SFRA266. It took me about 5 minutes to remove the screws from the case and pop in these two modules.\\n\\nWith the 1TB SSD upgrade and the 16GB memory upgrade, I can’t tell much difference between this laptop and a high end $1,000 model.\\n\\nIf you are just using this for casual web browsing without having to store much data, this is excellent right out of the box',\n",
       " 'very happy with this laptop. if your the type of person who just wants to youtube check email and browse the web but dont wanna feel like your laptop is a dinosaur. stop looking around spend the money it comes out to 400 and some change after tax and youll never look back. enjoy',\n",
       " \"Just received my prime day special. It is an attractive looking package but the fan runs a lot of the time and sounds like a jet engine. I'm used to my old Aspire E 15 which was quiet as a mouse. I really wanted to upgrade to quad core as well as get turbo speed out of the processor but the AMD software doesn't work on laptops apparently. So I'm stuck looking around for a way to speed the processor up from its average 1.7ghz speed. If my grandson hadn't broken the bezel on the old laptop I would have kept it as it was working perfectly. At least he his getting a great laptop.\",\n",
       " 'The first thing I want to say is this laptop is not a good value; the asking price is too high for what the product has to offer. This doesn\\'t mean it\\'s a bad laptop, rather, for the money, there are better options out there. The listing also has misinformation in it, notably it mentions an \"HD touch screen\" but this laptop does not have a touch screen. It also says it comes with Windows 10 Home, which is technically true, but it comes with S mode enabled. S mode does offer a value if this is going to be handed to a child who could be prone to getting viruses because this mode restricts executables (Apps) from running other than the Windows store. The good news is you can disable this, but it requires logging in with a microsoft account to do so. You also cannot revert back to S mode. To make this change, open Settings and go to Activation, then click the Go to the store option.\\n\\nGiven that this laptop is a budget laptop, and is probably aimed at non-tech savvy users who just want a machine to do work or school on (with optional light gaming), the review won\\'t be too technical and I\\'ll try to explain things in a manner that anyone can understand without spitting out a bunch of numbers or tech terms.\\n\\nDISPLAY: Starting with the display itself, it\\'s not very good. The viewing angles are bad, meaning when you look at it off angle as opposed to directly on, the picture starts to wash out and becomes more difficult to see. The resolution of the display is also only a baffling 1366x768, which falls short of the 1080p standard most displays are designed around. This means some websites will not scale properly on the display, as well as the picture not being as crisp as as 1080p screen would offer. The good news is the bezels, or the edging around the screen itself, is thin which looks nice and shows more of the screen.\\n\\nKEYBOARD: The keyboard is just okay to type on. You shouldn\\'t have any problems writing school essays or work reports on this: the key travel (the distance the keys push down before they register the input--which helps people who type \"feel\" when the input is activated to facilitate typing) is fair but if you want to write a novel I suggest another laptop with a more mechanical feel. Also, notably, there is no backlight (when the keys light up so you can see the keyboard in the dark) which is a big disappointment.\\n\\nPORTS: The available ports are: (Right side = SD storage, aux port for wired headphones) // (Left side = HDMI out (so you can connect the laptop to another monitor or TV that has HDMI in which will then display your laptop screen on that monitor or TV), one USB 3.0 , and two USB 2.0. The difference between 3.0 and 2.0 is the transfer speeds. If you stick in a flash drive, make sure you use the 3.0 slot. You can tell which one is 3.0 by looking at the image I put in this review.\\n\\nCPU: The processor included in this laptop is a bit worse than the latest comparable Intel option, the i3 10th gen mobile, but it\\'s also less expensive. This again goes into why I think this laptop doesn\\'t have a great value, because to me it\\'s worth $300 at most, but they\\'re asking for over $400 for it. When you look at laptops in the $380 range, you\\'re getting an intel i3 10th gen with a 1080p screen, and in some cases, more RAM and memory. However, that doesn\\'t mean it\\'s a bad processor. It\\'s quite good for what it is, actually. If the most you want to get out of this is to watch 1080p videos (even though the resolution of this laptop doesn\\'t go up to 1080p), the processor is more than capable of handling that.\\n\\nMEMORY: There is 4GB of RAM soldered to the motherboard, which is really the bare minimum a windows 10 laptop should have. Given that it\\'s soldered, you aren\\'t able to swap it out with something else, but the good news is there is an open slot on the motherboard to add your own RAM. If you want to go this route, which I suggest you do, here\\'s what you want to buy: you can go up to 8GB (for a total of 12--though I recommend just an additional 4GB stick for normal usage) of DDR4-2400Mhz 1.2v. If you\\'re looking at a listing of \"laptop RAM\" make sure it falls within those specifications. Getting to the memory banks is easy, even if you aren\\'t tech savvy I\\'ll easily explain how to do it safely: 1) turn the laptop completely off. 2) use a small screwdriver to remove all the screw underneath the laptop (be sure not to lose them). 3) near the hinges, lift your fingers up and slowly and carefully pry the back of the case off. I was very careful and still broke some tabs because it\\'s very cheaply made, but don\\'t worry if you do--the tabs don\\'t do a whole lot anyway. 4) once the back is off, add the RAM into the slot, and put the case back on and put the screws back in. Lastly, just make sure the case is sealed all around the edges by pinching them until it clicks back into place.\\n\\nSTORAGE: The 128GB SSD included is in NVME form, which just means if you want to replace the storage (can\\'t add onto it since there\\'s only one slot for stoage), you can do so with a bigger NVME drive. To replace this, look at the above steps for replacing the RAM and also follow the software transfer guide incluided in the NVME package for moving the operating system and your files over to the new drive.\\n\\nTOUCHPAD: The touchpad is pretty good. It\\'s fairly responsive and responds well to multi gesture touches, such as using two fingers to scroll up and down on webpages.\\n\\nWEBCAM: The webcam is horrendous. It will suffice at the bare minimum but the resolution is 480p at 30fps. If you don\\'t know what that means, just understand it\\'s well below average. Thankfully, there\\'s a privacy shutter which blocks the webcam so certain malicious ads and attackers can\\'t open your camera to see you while you are using the laptop.\\n\\nWEIGHT: The laptop itself is also too heavy for what it is. It\\'s almost 5lbs. Other companies are able to shave almost a pound off of a similarly-sized laptop.\\n\\nCHASIS: The chasis of the laptop is made out of plastic through-and-through. It flexes incredibly easy, meaning if you press down on it with a bit of force, the plastic will bend. The panel is also easy to flex, but this is to be expected on a laptop in this price point.\\n\\nGAMING: This laptop is capable of doing light gaming. I didn\\'t go too in depth with testing, but I did install minecraft and low visual settings, the game was running at a consistent 55fps for the most part, the lowest being a short dip of 18fps when it was loading a lot of things at once. There\\'s only one heat pipe on the motherboard, so it\\'s not really designed around cooling. The laptop will get pretty warm if you start to use it for heavy tasks, such as light gaming.\\n\\nBATTERY LIFE: The battery is decent. It could have been bigger, especially since there\\'s plenty of real estate in the laptop to allow it, but it was is a cost-cutting decision. However, during my testing, when I ran this laptop at 80% brightness and using \"Better performance\" in Windows 10 for the power output, I was able to get around 6 hours of YouTube watching from 100% until it forced itself in sleep mode to prevent it from shutting down completely.\\n\\nSPEAKERS: The speakers are surprisingly decent. You won\\'t be forced to use headphones with this. Other laptops that I\\'ve reviewed that are more expensive than this one had worse speakers, so this is a plus.\\n\\nIf you do decide to get this laptop, here are some things you should know:\\n+Setup is easy out of the box, but don\\'t connect it to the internet until you get to the desktop otherwise it will force you to create a microsoft account. If you want to do that, go for it, but I\\'d avoid it. However, if you want to disable S mode, you\\'ll need one anyway so weigh your options here.\\n\\n+It doesn\\'t have bloatware at all, meaning you don\\'t need to comb through the laptop to remove a bunch of unnecessary crap. In fact, the installed applications were one drive, some lenovo app, and office 365. I uninstalled 365 because I don\\'t need it, but keep it if you do, I think they give you a free trial.\\n\\n+When you get to the desktop, click the start menu and type Update, click \"Check for updates\". Click \"Advanced Options\" and enable the first option which says to Receive updates for other MS products when you update windows\". Click the back arrow then click Check for updates and keep installing updates until there aren\\'t any left to install.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the asking price of this laptop is too high for what you\\'re getting in return. There are other options that are cheaper or comparable that will get you more memory, a better CPU, and a better screen, but looking at this laptop in a vacuum, it\\'s not bad for what it is.',\n",

You can use a wireless mouse which is seen in one of my photos. The sound quality is a little meh, but not an issue if you hook up some speakers to it. The microphone works really well and paired with an actual headphone/microphone set the sound quality is crystal clear. Took a little bit of tweaking to get the screen brightness to actually look more \"crisp\" as you have to go into the system and change it yourself, not just simply adjusting the brightness. Easy to carry and feels a littl bulky but I prefer that so it doesn\\'t feel like it could snap at any moment, easy to fit in a backpack. The cord is a little on the small side so an extension cord may be needed depending on where you plug it in at.

       " \"I really liked this little machine and for the price, in my opinion is a steal. It is like 20% faster than my mini PC which sports an Intel Celeron N3450 Quad-core. Per my tests with the 64GB eMMC included, even Windows 10 (v2004) is snappy. I also ran Linux on it with no issues, except that the wireless driver needs to be installed manually(tested on Mx Linux for instance). The sequential reading for the Sandisk eMMC is 316 MB/s and 154 MB/s writing.\\n\\nOnce I booted up on the Windows installed, switched from Windows 10 in S Mode to Windows 10 Home for free in the Microsoft App Store and went ahead and activated the Office 365 subscription included for free(1 year). After that, I cleaned up the disk and installed everything from scratch. The drivers can be downloaded from the official Asus homepage. I had zero issues with Windows 10 20H1(v2004) but when tested version 20H2 (v2009), I had issues with the WIFI connection, so left 20H1.\\n\\nSomething interesting on this machine is that there's an empty slot for adding our own SSD NVME M.2. I didn't' test it myself as I didn't have a spare SSD, but there are a few videos where someone could put in a 1TB SSD.\\n\\nThe BIOS version included was v302, so one of the first things I did was to update to the latest version v306.\\n\\nI wish it had a backlit keyboard and an IPS screen. That would made it perfect for my needs. It's also very well built to be a cheap laptop.\\n\\nOverall, I would buy it again.\\n\\n[UPDATE 2-3-2021]\\n\\nI installed a 512GB SSD and it worked like a charm. The reading/writing speeds are around 1700/1200 MB/s respectively. I just added a screenshot.\\n\\nI did a triple boot (Windows 10, MX Linux and Chrome OS) using Refind and all is working fine.\\n\\nEDIT:\\n\\nI replaced the wireless card with an Intel Wifi6 AX200(Amazon B07SH6GV5S). This new card does not required me to install drivers at all on Windows 10(although intel recommends to install the latest driver version they provide and I did that), Linux (Kernel 5.8) or Chrome OS, which it's a plus for me. Also, tested on Windows 10 20H2 and found zero issues. Really happy with it. I almost forgot to say that this AX200 card also support Monitor Mode.\",\n",
       " \"I'm giving this little engine that could five stars. Why? Well, it's two hundred dollars. So I'm reviewing it as a two hundred dollar product. If I was comparing it to a Macbook Air M1, it would probably be three stars. If I was comparing it to a Microsoft Surface, three and a half. But it's a small, budget laptop, and in that category, it's excellent.\\n\\nQUICK RUNDOWN - It blows my mind how good of a job they did with this. I've used a lot of computers, and this one impresses me. If you've ever had a Chromebook, or even just a cheap (or perhaps even more expensive) laptop you'll feel the difference immediately. It has a few issues, none of which are deal breakers, but it has many, many pros. Read on.\\n\\nPROS --\\nIncredible Price to Performance Ratio\\nVery well built, with no cheap parts\\nFull-size, comfortable keyboard\\nSmall and lightweight\\nGood design (add stickers if it's a little too plain for you)\\nFull Windows 10 License, and no hardwired bloatware\\nInternal NVMe slot and external SD Card slot\\nI could keep going... it's $200.\\n\\nCONS --\\nNo backlight keyboard (at least on the 11.6 model)\\nSome irksome viewing angle problems\\nMaddeningly little built in storage\\nAlmost too little RAM\\n\\nI've divided the review into individual sections: webcam, speakers, performance, software, etc, so scroll down to the one that's most important to you, or read the review from top to bottom. They are (in order):\\n\\nIntroduction (above)\\nWeight & Build\\nKeyboard and Trackpad\\nScreen\\nBattery\\nPerformance (including Gaming)\\nWebcam\\nSpeakers & Sound\\nSoftware\\nOther (SD Card Slot, NVMe slot, HDMI output, heating, cleaning)\\nConclusion\\nLinks to Accessories\\n\\nLet me start with a few disclaimers. First, I've only been using it for a few weeks, which is about enough time to get a good sense of its mettle and iron out any problems it has. There's been a few things I've noticed that I've added to this review, (see 'performance' and 'screen') and I'll add more if more arise. No problem has been significant enough that it made me in any way wonder if it was worth. $200 is a really good price point.\\n\\nThe second disclaimer, is there's a few reviewers saying either A, they got a dud, or B, it clunked out on them after two years. Duds happen, with any product, this is no exception. So if mine does decided to go on the fritz, I'll update my review relative to the exchange process - I WON'T deduct stars *just* because it gave out. Second, if you get two years of solid use out of this, it's a good product. Just buy another one.\\n\\nWith that being said, let me get into the details.\\n\\nWEIGHT AND BUILD - This is one of its greatest strengths, and rivals many laptops in higher price ranges. There's no creaks, no cheap plastic waiting to shatter, it's not a flimsy toy. It's a solid electronic. It feels right, in your hands, on your lap, on a desk. So many laptops try and woo you with larger screens or better specs [or, for the life of me, a lower price tag], and turn out to be cup coasters you have to plug in. Not this. It really feels like it has some life in it.\\n\\nIt's not obscenely light, like a MacBook Air, but you can move about and use it on your lap without strain. If traveling's your kind of thing, then the weight is sufficient. I would feel comfortable carrying it through an airport.\\n\\nThe screen hinge feels durable and like it won't be breaking anytime soon, and when you set it at the position you like, it stays. The laptop isn't super-ultra-mega thin, but it is thin, and that's a nice bonus. You could probably fit it in an envelope, just maybe a slightly larger envelope then the one Steve Jobs used.\\n\\nKEYBOARD AND TRACKPAD - The keyboard, I'm in love with. It's full size; no cramping on tiny keys or accidentally presses. The give is decisive and gratifying, and it just feels good to use. The keyboard is actually the one (literally, the only one) thing I feel they cut a little too close to the corner on. There's no backlight. It appears as those some of the models have a backlight, though I'm not sure, but mine doesn't. (I got the 11.6 model). This can be a little frustrating, and I'm considering getting a book light so I can type in the dark. Again, this is a two hundred dollar laptop, so it is what it is. I'll make due.\\n\\nAnother note, is they put the 'delete' key right next to the power key. Shucks. A few times, I've gone to press the delete key, and the computer goes into sleep mode. This is more of an inconvenience than anything. Just press the power button again and it will start right back up where you left off. Still, if you're doing sensitive work, it's something to consider, and I'm sure you'll learn very quickly to be cautious.\\n\\nAlso, the 'enter' key is green. I thought this was strange, but I really like it. Hard to explain.\\n\\nThe trackpad is responsive and that click is also decisive and gratifying. I don't have any issues accidentally pressing it while I'm typing, and it's very good at doing what I expect it to. If I click or tap, the mouse clicks. If I click on the right, it right clicks. Scrolling is painless and intuitive and very nuanced. The numpad on the keyboard is a nice touch, though I would have traded it for a backlit keyboard.\\n\\nSCREEN - Going back to where we started, this is a two hundred dollar laptop. You're not getting an Apple Retina display. It has some minor viewing angle problems you'll have to accommodate for. If you're looking directly at it, everything looks good - pure colors, no whitening. If you turn it horizontally or bend the screen back, there's a noticeable change in tone. It is what it is, and it likely won't interfere with your work. Just don't do color grading for professional photoshoots on it.\\n\\nThe screen resolution is just right. The screen is small, but there's enough room to do what you want and then some. This is one of the most significant factors in comfort. If it were cramped, it would give you a headache and strain your eyes. But they did a good job of making sure there's some breathing room with a healthy buffer zone around whatever it is you're focusing on. You feel like you can move and engage in multiple things.\\n\\nThere's a few reviews complaining it's not a touch screen. You can't please everyone. It's not something I feel is missing, especially for $200.\\n\\nUPDATE: There's seems to be an issue with the screen calibration. Frequently, it will turn noticeably yellow, and by right clicking on the desktop and clicking 'display settings,' it seems to at least temporarily fix it. I believe very much this is a software issue, so it's unlikely you'll encounter it, but it would be interesting to know if others are encountering the same problem.\\n\\nBATTERY - The battery life is on point. The time remaining Windows estimates seems to vary quite a bit, but I watched two movies and used it for 4 hours, and still had 17%. It's the kind of thing you can charge at night and it will last you the day under normal conditions. It also doesn't have quick charge, another little cut corner, but I'm not stressing about it. Then again, I'm around a power outlet most of the time. If quick charge is an issue for you, you're in the wrong price point.\\n\\nSide note: the charging port really plugs in. You have to give it a little oomph to pull it out. Which can be a pro and a con. You definitely don't want to trip on the cord; the whole thing will go flying off the table. But you can reposition the device without having to worry about the cord falling out.\\n\\nPERFORMANCE - This is actually one of its biggest strengths, and really surprised me. All the components come together to create a seamless experience. I was nervous about the odd named Intel Processor (N6 something something) but it turns out, it's actually an Intel Celeron. And only four gigs of memory? Doesn't seem like quite enough. But it somehow manages to muscle out the minimum, and have some left over. My guess is, this is largely due to the SSD. Just a few years ago, laptop manufacturers had two options for storage: a physical hard drive, which was expensive, bulky, and a power drain, or some sort of memory like a thumb drive. Both were slow and huge bottle necks.\\n\\nWell, this thing has a Solid State Drive. And that makes all the difference. With a decent processor, just enough memory, and the SSD, it will breeze through any routine task you ask it to do: open Microsoft Word, surf the web, torrent files, play music, and it will do it all without a hitch. Performance, under reasonable conditions, should never be a problem: you'll never feel a pause or get frustrated.\\n\\nI LOVE the original Warhammer: 40K: Dawn of War series. This plays it effortlessly, even with mods. Which is very welcomed. I can imagine it can also play Sins of a Solar Empire, Age of Empires, Among Us, Terraria, and maybe even Minecraft, if that's your kind of thing. Check out GOG.com (great old games) and you'll be surprised at what's out there. If you are planning to do some light gaming, the NVMe slot will really come in handy.\\n\\nIMPORTANT EDIT: After using it for some weeks, the lack of RAM is starting to become an issue. Windows has done a good job managing memory, but even day-to-day tasks can overwhelm it. This expresses itself as stalled applications, dropped Chrome tabs, or even system notifications that the system has run out of Memory. It did reach a significant error, though - everything went black, and after a reboot, Windows wanted to help set up my system (which is a big error.) Luckily everything was intact, my files, settings and programs. So it's just kind of a startling headache.\\n\\nI was running a few programs, nothing too demanding. So if you're planning on using this for anything more then Spotify and Chrome, be forewarned.\\n\\nWEBCAM - The webcam is about what you would expect. It's a hefty 0.3 megapixels, but there aren't any dropped frames, and the color processing is alright. If you need a webcam on the fly, it'll due. If you use a webcam for any serious purposes, I would suggest investing in a nice one, which you were probably going to do anyway. The device will be able to handle it without issue.\\n\\nOf special note, is the microphone, which is actually great. Audio comes through clear and audible, distinct and focused. If you do find yourself in a situation where you have to use the onboard webcam, the video quality won't be great, but you won't have any problem being heard and understood.\\n\\nSPEAKERS & SOUND - The speakers are placed under the device, pointing directly down. You would think this would make them impossible to hear, but it projects and doesn't distort the sound. I've watched a few movies, and haven't had an issue hearing them - it gets plenty loud. I'm a bit of an audiophile, (though there are many more advance then I), and what I can say about these speakers is they're passable. They're not so bad that you're getting irked with the sound quality, but they're not so good you would enjoy Beethoven's 5th. The various aspects of sound - the bass, and whatever else the other parts are called, are balanced and clear.\\n\\nIf you're using it for casual media use, the lackluster sound quality will fade into the background and you'll be able to enjoy whatever it is you're doing.\\n\\nThe headphone amplifier is decent and it appears they didn't skimp on it. I tested it with a pair of Sony MDR7506s (which are one-for-one studio monitors with a higher than average impedance.) The amplifier didn't quit reach optimal levels, but it produced clear and pleasing sound. (and it does have a nice kick to it.) For an onboard amplifier, it's more then adequate. If you're a real audiophile and use an external amplifier, the primary factor to consider is if the sound it's putting out can be boosted, and it definitely can.\\n\\nSOFTWARE - There's a few pieces of bloatware you'll want to uninstall. McAfee, Skype, MyAsus. (if you don't know what bloatware is, ask the techy in your family to remove it for you.) Fortunately, none of them are hard coded into the software or hardware, so uninstalling them is straight forward and simple and can be done through 'Add or Remove Programs.' The laptop does come in Windows S mode (which is suppose to be a simpler version of Windows, but has some bothersome limitations for power users.) They made it extremely easy to convert into regular Windows 10. I clicked a button once and haven't had to worry about it since: full Windows 10.\\n\\nOTHER - What I find really helpful is the SD Card Slot. The 64 gigs of storage it comes with goes REALLY quick. I like to watch, uh, documentaries in public domain (like 'Joker' with Joaquin Phoenix). It's amazingly simple to plug in an SD card (I got a 256gb one for $45), set up uTorrent to load all the unfinished and finished torrents onto the card, and that solves the whole problem. Just about any SD card you buy will be fast enough to download movies and play one at the same time.\\n\\nOther reviewers have pointed out it comes with a slot for an NVMe SSD. If you don't know what that is, it probably doesn't make much of a difference. If you do, it's a very helpful addition. Hooray.\\n\\nIt has tons of ports, which is great. Two USB ports, a USB-C port, the above mentioned SD card slot, an auxiliary port, and an HDMI port. I've used the HDMI port on a full screen TV, and it works for watching a movie. The quality of the movie file will make a difference - but the sound compression changes that are necessary with downloaded media [generally done through VLC] help a lot. It's not blu-ray, but performance doesn't seem to be affected by what's happening in a scene or the amount of sound.\\n\\nIf you're planning on using this for presentations, it's exactly what you want. Plug, play 'n forget.\\n\\nDuring normal, unplugged, use you wouldn't be able to tell that it's turned on just by the heat. If you're running a process-intensive program or have it plugged in, it does heat up, but that's normal. You can use it on your lap without a worrying. I don't see heating being an issue. It's also fanless, which is a big deal if you live in a dusty environment. You won't slowly be running it into the ground just by using it, listening to the fan whir louder and louder as it tries to compensate for all the dust.\\n\\nSide note: If it overheats, it'll just turn off. It won't hurt it.\\n\\nI like to take good care of my computers, so ease of cleaning matters to me. Being fanless, that alleviates a lot of of the issues you would come across. Still, you can't access behind the keyboard, so it will be interesting to see how that plays out. You might be able to remove each key and clean it out, which would go a long way, but I wouldn't try it without doing some research and carefully weighing the benefits and risks.\\n\\nEither way, do yourself a favor: buy a small pack of Q-tips, a little bottle of house hold cleaner (Pinesol works well), and lens clothes, and throw them in the bag or case you're carrying the laptop in. Occasionally go over the keyboard with the Q-tips and wipe down the exterior, and the lens cloth will come in handy a lot more then you think. I don't know if it will necessarily add to the life of the machine, but it will feel a lot better. And it's worth taking some pride in your devices.\\n\\nCONCLUSION - The bottom line is, is it feels good to use. Everything from the keyboard to the performance to the build quality makes it a very enjoyable and complete experience: there's nothing really lacking that will get in your way. It's spectacular for day-to-day use, and it's got a little muscle to it. For $200, you're getting a real product, and it even has something to say to higher end laptops. If you decide to go with this, I think you'll be very pleased.\\n\\nLINK TO ACCESSORIES - Some may find this helpful. These are subject to change - Amazon is always adding or removing their product offerings, so if one's not available, these should at least give you an idea of what to look for. But at the time of this writing, these are the accessories I purchased for it, and that all work.\\n\\nSD Card (256gb, $40) - Lots of storage to hold a small collection of movies, music, or pictures. Plenty fast enough.\\nhttps://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07FCR3316/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1\\n\\nLaptop Case ($12) - The laptop fits perfectly.\\nhttps://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00VVLE5CG/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o06_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1\\n\\nMicrofiber Clothes ($8) - You can never have too many of these.\\nhttps://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0050R67U0/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o06_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1\\n\\nWireless Mouse ($16) - Oddly, the little LEDS in it aren't nearly as bright as advertised, but it's a great mouse. Good click, the scroll wheel is nice. And it has an option between Bluetooth or dongle.

       " 'HP has a number of different lines of laptops, and plain \"HP\" is the budget line (there\\'s also the EliteBook, Spectre, ZBook, and so on.) At first glance, the chassis looks very similar to the EliteBooks, but once you touch it, you get that all-plastic feel that says \"cheap\".\\n\\nThere are a couple of specifications that, at the time of this writing, do not match the model. This is listed as having a fingerprint sensor, but it doesn\\'t. It also doesn\\'t have a backlit keyboard.\\n\\nThe computer itself is quite light for a 17\", owing much to the plastic chassis. The display is... well, not very good. It\\'s very dim relative to most 17\" displays, the viewing angle isn\\'t great, and despite having a matte finish, light sources reflect off of it easily. This is definitely a display for content consumption rather than content creation.\\n\\nThe i5 processor is sufficient enough for basic use. I probably wouldn\\'t want to render things with this computer, but you don\\'t have to worry about running Office, some browser tabs, and something like Spotify at the same time. Cooling on the CPU is passable, at best. With the fan pushing at max speed, the bottom can still get a bit toasty. I\\'m not sure how HP has tuned their thermal management system, but it seems to me that they\\'re going for silence over performance.\\n\\nThe included 8 GB is a bit sparse, though. The spec sheet on this model shows that it has 2x4 GB SO-DIMMs, and I was happy to see that there were just four normal Phillips screws on the bottom. However, this would lead to disappointment when I tried to verify that the RAM wasn\\'t soldered on. HP doesn\\'t want you poking around the guts of this computer. When I removed the screws, I expected the keyboard to drop -- as this is a upper-into-lower configuration where they top of the system chassis and keyboard are a single integrated piece into a bowl-type lower chassis. It didn\\'t drop, though. Even with proper fancypants wedge tools, all the plastic wanted to do was flex. Fearing a cracked case, I gave up. HP is usually pretty good about publishing service manuals, but as of this writing, they don\\'t have one up for the 17-cn0021nr.\\n\\nAs for other aspects, they\\'re pretty good. The keyboard is more solid than I was expecting -- not really far off from my EliteBook in terms of feel and key travel. Though I did miss the backlighting on the black-on-silver keycaps. Other than in bright light, they can be difficult to read. And while I prefer keyboards without numpads, the positioning and offset trackpad made this comfortable to type with.\\n\\nThe included AC adapter is on the small side for a 17\" laptop, though I\\'m disappointed that HP went with their proprietary pin adapter instead of a USB-C solution. Of note though: the adapter from my 2020 EliteBook 15 worked fine, despite being overpowered.\\n\\nAs much as I\\'d like to recommend this, the one thing that probably differentiates this laptop in the price range is the big 17\" display -- and it just isn\\'t that great. I\\'d probably sacrifice the 2\" of real estate and get something with a better display for a similar cost.',\n",
       " 'If you can get past the bloatware (easy enough with a reformat) that comes pre-installed, this is actually a decent laptop. It boots up fast after the initial setup, the i5 processor is plenty capable for all but the most demanding tasks, and the 8GB RAM is sufficient for daily use. But there\\'s a big problem that IS tough to look (literally) past...\\n\\nThe screen on this laptop is absolutely atrocious. The resolution is about the equivalent of 720p - on a new laptop - in 2021.... Um, what? As if that weren\\'t bad enough, the colors are completely washed out from the tremendous backlight bleeds - and not even just along the edges or in the corners - the whole screen has a white glow to it! It really is a shame because as I stated above, the specs on this are pretty good and it\\'s very capable, but that doesn\\'t help if you can\\'t comfortably look at what you\\'re doing.\\n\\nThe build quality is about what you should expect at this price point (which I don\\'t fully know because it\\'s \"unavailable\" at the time of review). It\\'s very much all plastic, but doesn\\'t feel overly-cheap. I didn\\'t like the trackpad though - even when tapping (instead of clicking) it still moves enough to make a \"click\" sound. But it works well-enough. The stated specs in the description are inaccurate - they say it has 1x8GB RAM sticks in it, yet the computer reports 2x4GB. This is better for performance but adds expense to an upgrade to 16GB. I did not open the laptop to verify whether or not the SSD or RAM is easily upgradeable for fear of breaking some of the plastic bits. Also, I would\\'ve appreciated a built-in Ethernet port. I know WiFi is good enough for most people, but it\\'s still nice to have the option. A card reader would\\'ve been nice too, but I know I\\'m starting to add a lot of wants to a very cheap machine.\\n\\nSo overall, I am disappointed in this laptop and don\\'t recommend it. There are far better choices for the money. if you absolutely NEED a 17-inch at this price point then this one will perform okay. But just be prepared for its huge shortcoming with the screen they chose to put in here. They should\\'ve subsidized one more piece of bloatware to get a better LCD panel.',\n",

Taking a look at the online reviews shows that the screen isn't the best, and it takes a few more hits, but even so it looks like an amazing deal. After using it, in my opinion it's worth the money, but not as fantastic as it appears.\\n\\nTLDR: Look at what you want in a laptop before buying this one. For me it works fine but there are a few key drawbacks that might affect different tasks you would want to use this laptop for.\\n\\nThe PRO's\\n+ Build Quality is fantastic, with sturdy metal and a keyboard I surprisingly quite enjoy using.\\n+ Big PRO: The Ryzen 4700U processor is a beast, and the snappiest processor I've used. Productivity use such as coding, taking notes in class, running other professional programs like the Microsoft suite or Zoom are handled easily and perfectly.\\n+ Big PRO: A 512GB SSD for this price is incredible! And it's even a really good SSD at that.\\n\\nThe CON's\\n- The screen is as bad as they say, even after calibration. It's only slightly better than my old laptop I bought for $350 a few years ago. However, as someone who doesn't use the laptop for video editing, it's not a big issue for me, but everything does look more green/blue than it should.\\n- I've had software problems with this laptop that I would not have expected from a pre-built laptop, especially from a company like Acer. I have problems with apps being fuzzy (not scaling to the display properly), problems with Cortana and the Windows Start menu, and problems with the screen not immediately waking from sleep. These problems are rare and/or not too impactful, but still annoying.\\n- The BIGGEST CON by far is the thermals. The laptop has amazing specs as I mentioned above, but it can't use them to their full potential because the components get too hot and have to cut back on speed. The fans are noisy and run at full speed often. I regularly experience temps of 70°+ while web browsing, and 90°+ while (light) gaming or other more intensive tasks.\\nTo me that is a huge letdown, as this laptop does not perform heavy tasks like it should. The processor is limited by the cooling of the laptop and can't really do all that it's has the potential to do.\\n\\nOverall, I am disappointed by the low upper limit of the hardware, but for my needs as a tech-savvy college student looking for a good laptop for classes, it's perfect. It's light and portable, sturdy, fast, and cheap. Even the gaming/heavy use cases are.... acceptable, even if they aren't what they could be. I recommend this laptop to many people, but it's not for everyone.\",\n",
       " \"I try really hard not to do same-day delivery reviews, no matter how great I think the product is because you can never tell on that first day what might go wrong later. However, I am actually confident and happy enough with this one to go for it. If I make amendments later, they won't likely be anything that changes this rating. (updated 6/19/20 - one week, using it for work in web design and content creation, still love it)\\n\\nI needed a business-appropriate laptop. My requirements for this were pretty simple: something with a sharp but conservative appearance, MOBILE (not heavy or bulky), but also just as powerful (or capable of being just as powerful) as my much larger personal laptop. It came down to this and the Lenovo Flex. I chose this because the design was all metal, and I liked Macbook Airs when working as an Apple systems manager for their durability, style, and mobility. It's just a shame the RAM is not upgradeable (it's soldered). The RAM on the Lenovo Flex is not upgradeable either, though. It also comes with a weaker processor (Ryzen 5, which isn't quite on the i7's level). I doubt anyone will need more than 8 to 16GB of RAM in the lifetimes of these laptops. I knew that if I got a Ryzen 5 that would just make me want the Ryzen 7 processor more (you can never upgrade processors in a laptop). So, despite toting less RAM, Swift still came out as the winner both in design and performance when I compared it up close to the Flex online.\\n\\nI worried a bit when I read a review that complained about the screen and graphics on Swift being almost unusable. But I clearly had nothing to worry about. Those professional reviewers sometimes can get so snobby with hardware, they set the bar higher than anyone in the real world would ever set it.\\n\\nThe screen is semi-matte. I have very sensitive eyes, sensitive enough that I often have to wear blue light blocking glasses to deal with sunlight, bright indoor lights, or computer light. Even the slightest flicker is noticeable to me in a very uncomfortable, painful kind of way that strains my eyes. There's the tiniest amount of flicker in this display. It is NOTHING like the reviews have been describing, which made me afraid I wouldn't be able to use this laptop. It's VERY easy on my eyes after switching the AMD Radeon settings to Enhanced and High Res (which simultaneously smoothes and sharpens up the text, making it more legible). It also does NOT have a glossy, highly reflective screen. The screen is semi-matte at the worst (honestly, it's not even that much), and it's full matte once it's turned on. Evidently Acer has switched displays after the complaints (they tend to be good about doing things like that). It gets super bright, and the colors are close to true as far as I can tell - only publishing something is going to reveal the truth there, which I haven't done yet. But again, I can't believe what a close call it is to a Macbook Air.\\n\\nThe graphics performance: It's not a gaming laptop, though I'm sure it is good enough to play most games on medium and would be PERFECT for a student. It's definitely strong enough to perform smoothly for graphic artists, photographers, and anyone that tends to keep a ton of tabs open in their browser. Smooth scrolling and rendering, no lag or glitching.\\n\\nI cannot compliment the Ryzen 7 processor enough. I am moving from an 8th gen i7 and the Ryzen 7 is WAY more responsive and less prone to freezing or errors. I can very easily believe it maxes out at 4ghz. Those eight cores handle multitasking like a true champ.\\n\\nI was worried the RAM would give me some issues with work because it's only 8gb and it's also underpowered to help boost battery performance. So far, I've been surprised to find that this low-powered RAM actually keeps up with me despite my issues with never exiting or closing windows, lol.\\n\\nThe keyboard is extremely comfortable if you have small to medium-sized hands. There is some time to adjust to the smaller form factor. Large handed people will immediately hate the keyboard because it's compact. This being said, it IS a large keyboard as far as COMPACT keyboards go, and it is 100% identical to the keyboard on the Macbook Air. Same feel and everything. Backlit keys, which you can switch on or off. Something SUPER cool is that Acer figured out how to include a Numlock and number keypad on it by marking some of the letter keys with numbers, then adding a Numlock. (check my pictures)\\n\\nIf you turn on the manual equalizer in the audio settings and crank it up, the speakers actually get really loud, and they're nice that way too (no rattle, no stress on the drivers). By default though, I can easily see tons of folks complaining about the speakers not getting loud. They don't get loud at all by default. With the equalizer maxed out, I would compare them to a mini Bluetooth speaker.\\n\\nIn short, don't buy this for audio unless you're planning on connecting it to different speakers. For normal casual usage, like watching YouTube videos or streaming movies, the built-in speakers should be just fine.\\n\\nThe lid is very well hinged. The screen is reinforced as well. Dropping it may cause some cosmetic damage, but it should hold up in most cases. At the worst, you'll be looking at a little cosmetic damage (scratches, dings) and a busted screen. Which is better than what you could face with the typical plastic body. I once dropped a plastic body laptop off the back of my car (I was an idiot and left it on the hood). It totally destroyed the body... the laptop still worked, but there was bare PCB board everywhere. It was ugly, lol.\\n\\nNow, there are complaints about battery life on this, but I haven't had any problems. I also didn't go with default settings in some key areas, though. I changed the Radeon settings to focus more on battery life than performance. Then I changed the power settings to best battery life. Now, I don't consider this to be much, especially with my huge collection of background apps, but considering complaints saying the battery wouldn't last more than an hour... hmmm. I'm not seeing it. I've been on battery for an hour now, and have 12h 46m remaining after charging to 98%. I'm guessing the expected battery life will hang somewhere between 4.5h and 6h on medium.\\n\\nOverall, it's a great machine and an awesome value in my book. I have no idea why the pro reviewers thought so poorly of it (though they did give it respect as a budget laptop). Maybe they were comparing it to more expensive laptops instead of comparing it to other models in this price range....? Or maybe the older version of this was really that bad.\\n\\nWhatever. I'm sticking with this because IT WORKS.\\n\\nUpdate: Two months later... it's still running like the day I got it. I'm actually shocked that it continues to perform so well on 8GB of energy saving RAM. I am guessing the difference lies in a combo of using a better processor and using a solid state drive. My other laptop has an A12, which is quad core and goes up to 3ghz - this Ryzen 7 is octacore and goes up to 4ghz.\\n\\nThe Care Center app has a function in it to make the battery only change to 80% when it's plugged in (saves the battery cells from being burned out). So despite using it plugged in all the time, I have not lost any battery health. It still goes for six hours or more off battery.\",\n",
       " 'First and foremost, this thing is tiny, I\\'m pretty sure most phones are bigger than this. The keyboard is completely unusable, irredeemably awful would be too kind. The battery life is unimpressive, and the processing \"power\" that so many ostensibly professional reviewers were blown away by has been noticeably absent. Often opening a simple menu will cause the cursor icon to visibly stutter. And the heat that this thing produces, even on stand-by, leads me to believe it will be a very short lived piece of hardware.\\n\\nWorst of all, and most inexcusable, using anything other than the bloated installation of Windows 10 it comes with is made essentially impossible by the complete and total lack of driver support. Simple things like the touchpad won\\'t work, and Acer couldn\\'t be bothered to make those drivers available. I didn\\'t buy this out the back of a van in a Safeway parking lot, I don\\'t think it\\'s unreasonable to expect a modicum of basic support.

I suspect due to the 'chip shortage' Dell was forced to dive into the ol' parts bin and ship this particular 3583 with an older - and MUCH lower specs - Pentium Gold 5th generation CPU with limited cache. To try to compensate, Dell also shipped this unit with a M.2 SSD rather than the spec'd spinning HDD. That was very good of them. But the mis-match seems to be creating some lag in 'getting things done', although not critical. I may (probably) be wrong about this, but then I'm not a computer whiz. It would be great if Dell eventually tracked this order and in future shipped us a comparable Core i3 CPU with a realistic cache. Hey, I can dream!

I tried to fix the problem but at the end is just that the audio jack is simply not working properly which was a great disappointment. I didn't see anyone in the comments complaining about this so, I assume I just simply go a faulty one however, the laptop seems to be performing well overall for the moment but still for a laptop of this price range you expect for everything to be working properly.\\n\\nUPDATE: After two weeks of having this the audio jack issue I had from the beginning it fixed it self out of nowhere and haven't give me a similar problem ever since so, I am assuming it was a driver issue. I was waiting to at least have this for 30 days to update this so here we go. The specs of this laptop are pretty decent and RAM card is upgradable which is great but apparently SSD is not but I bought an external one and it's working fine so no complaints there. I love the size of this thing and how bulky it feels but, I am still pretty sure that if you drop it, it will break even though it says it's military grade so, you don't want to be letting this fall to the ground. Software wise I had an issue with the explorer.exe getting extremely slow, which was a pain to deal with, now to be fair this could've been related to a specific software I installed but I couldn't fully confirm this. For the moment being everything is working well but it feels kinda fragile in a software spect. Gaming wise is pretty darn good, it runs GTA, GOW, Apex and other games like a charm and it's VR ready as well which I use a lot.\\n\\nI fully ecommend this laptop if you want it just for gaming but if you want to do other things on it like the creative stuff I use it for as well, I still recommend it but I really hope you don't go into to many technical stuff as I have which are fixable but very annoying.\\n\\nIf buying, keep in mind that i have the i5 Intel core processor version and a lot of the bad reviews I seen are for the Ryzen processor version so I don't know if that has something do with anything but the experience may be different depending on which one you choose.

       " 'Dell Inspiron 13 5310, 13.3 Inch QHD (Quad High Definition) Non-Touch Laptop - Intel Core i7-11370H, 16GB DDR4 RAM, 512GB SSD, NVIDIA GeForce MX450 with 2GB GDDR6, Platinum Silver (Latest Model)\\n\\nThe laptop comes securely packaged in a recyclable cardboard box, with molded cardboard padding holding the laptop inside. I like to see that big companies are being more conscious about recycling materials with their shipping. Besides the laptop, inside the box, you will find the USBC power supply and two small pamphlets, one for warranty and safety rags and one for a quick start guide, including a QR code so you can go directly to the Dell support page if you have a difficulty. flipping through the pages there\\'s not a lot of information here you get the basic info and locations of all the buttons, camera, and speakers, as well as very basic information for the device. That\\'s not unusual these days, as many laptop manufacturers are putting the instruction manuals online, or on the device itself. I put the laptop on to charge while I went about my day, as most devices are not shipped with a full charge.\\nTurning the laptop on for the first time, the power button is not labeled as such, because it is the same button as the fingerprint scanner. I thought this was a little strange at first, but the more I thought about it, it made sense because once you turn it on you\\'ll need to scan your print to unlock it. As the laptop starts, it launches into the middle of Windows installation, because you\\'re actually installing Windows for the first time when you turn on a new laptop. The default settings for the startup uses Cortana to narrate the setup procedures and walk you through the procedure. You can control most of it by voice and answering questions, or you can turn the speaker off and enjoy the quiet while you press buttons. The default sound setting for the laptop is about half / 50% of full, which is still pretty loud for Cortana. The keys are backlit and have three settings only, two intensity settings low and high, and off. In the process of setting up, it asks you to log in with your Microsoft account. If you have more than one Windows device, I heartily recommend creating a Microsoft account if you don\\'t have one already. Not only will it register that copy of Windows with Microsoft so you never have to worry about losing the key, but you can also use your phone for two-factor authentication and not have to worry about remembering your password every time you log into Microsoft. Also, for further securing your laptop, this model offers a fingerprint sensor. I very much recommend that you use it, and add a second finger after the setup finishes, just in case you ever have a Band-Aid on your first finger. That\\'s happened to me before and I had to mess about with trying to remember security codes instead of simply scanning my fingerprint in a half a second. You can even set up your phone to communicate with Windows now so that while you\\'re on your laptop you can get your messages right on the computer. They also include a 1-month trial of Microsoft 365, which will come in handy if you plan on purchasing the Microsoft 365 family which according to the computer is $100 a year plus taxes. That\\'s a little too expensive for me, so I declined it. I can\\'t see spending that much for Microsoft office when excellent substitutions that work with the same documents such as open office are available for free. The laptop also comes with McAfee security, which I\\'m sure is a trial. As soon as the trial is up, I plan on uninstalling McAfee and going with Windows defender. In my opinion, McAfee takes up way too many resources. After you set these up, Windows finalizes set up with a great big blue screen that says quote this might take several minutes, don\\'t turn off your PC, leave everything to us \". After a fairly short time, windows will boot to your basic windows desktop. The resident program shortcuts that are installed with the machine are Microsoft Edge, file explorer, the Microsoft store, your mailbox, My Dell Support, and Alexa. Also, since I logged in with my Microsoft account and agreed to sync with the rest of my computers, it pulled my desktop shortcuts and those are placed onto my desktop as well. Once it finishes that, you get a pop-up to register your computer with Dell for warranty activation, expedited diagnostics, and product updates. Using the keyboard to type in my information to register for the warranty, I find the keys to be soft but have a secure almost \" click \" feeling to it as you make your keystrokes. I like that it has this tactile feeling to it because even though I am not a touch typer, sometimes I do type fairly quickly and I like to feel the key action as I type.\\nOnce all of the setups are complete, I like to run Windows updates. Even though when you open Windows update if it says you have no updates, press the button again because, sure enough! There is a bunch of updates. No matter how brand new your computer is, there\\'s bound to be a bunch of updates that have been created between the time your computer was manufactured and shipped to you and turn it on once you have it on your hands. Don\\'t be afraid to restart Windows and run updates until there are no more updates available. In the process of running these updates, I heard the fan turn on for the first time. It did take a little while for the machine to get warm enough to need the fan, and I was happy to see that the fan was very quiet and not noisy at all.\\nIn downloading and installing my preferred programs, one of the things I prefer is Google Chrome for my main browser, [sorry edge], and I found it interesting to see that as I was typing “ download Google Chrome \" into the address/search bar, that after only a couple of letters it auto-completed the phrase to download Google Chrome. Somehow that says something about how many people don\\'t enjoy Edge as their preferred browser.\\nOnce you have everything up and running, you\\'ll get a push notification to update the Dell support assistant. It\\'s actually a handy program that will, with a little help from you, keep your computer 100% up-to-date with driver downloads, hardware configuration as well as tuning up your performance, and optimizing your internet connections. One thing I did find interesting about the Dell support Assistant, is it also carried an update to the BIOS firmware, which I thought was a little unusual but not unwelcome. Don\\'t be surprised if this takes a few minutes.\\nEnd using this laptop for my everyday tasks, I\\'m pretty happy with how speedy and snappy it is, and the screen is crisp and clean. watching a streaming movie on it definitely came through in high definition.\\nThe bottom line on this laptop?

I’m a bit of a “keyboard peeker” when typing, so this is a bit frustrating…there’s probably a way to adjust the setting…I just don’t know how to.

       " 'SUMMARY\\nA surprisingly well-rounded and well equipped budget chromebook that doesn\\'t get the attention it deserves.\\n\\nLEAD-UP TO THE PURCHASE\\nHaving recently given my Google Pixelbook to a friend who was in desperate need of a computer, I was in the market for another chromebook... just in time for Prime Day June 2021. I didn\\'t need a powerhouse since I have learned firsthand that running Linux on a chromebook sounds better on paper than it does in real life use.\\n\\nThe 2-in-1 form-factor was fun to tinker with but in practical day-to-day use, I found it better to use a dedicated Android tablet (Samsung Galaxy Tab S6) for touch and pen tasks. A traditional clamshell design would be fine for those \"laptop-y\" things... and an 11\" or so screen would allow for a very portable device.\\n\\nPRIME DAY HUNTING\\nWith those requirements in mind, I went hunting in the Amazon (see what I did there? ;-) ) for a suitable chromebook. I found that most of the deals were for devices that had been released two or more years ago. A few other \"deals\" weren\\'t any cheaper than the regular prices at other stores (for the same processor/RAM/storage configurations).\\n\\nI ran across the Lenovo Chromebook 3 (LCB3 for short) and it really intrigued me. Not only was it quite inexpensive, but it had a decent processor (Celeron N4020), decent storage (64GB), and more ports (2-USBC, 2 USBA 3.0, microSD card slot, and headphone/mic jack) than my old Google Pixelbook (2 USBC, headphone/mic jack).\\n\\nI watched some reviews on Youtube for this device and only one gave it a half-decent review. In spite of the lack of glowing reviews, I purchased it.\\n\\nUNBOXING AND USE\\nWhen the LCB3 arrived and I opened the box, I was impressed with the look and feel of this chromebook. I don\\'t have to qualify this comment with (...for a $170 chromebook). No, it is legitimately a good looking and feeling chromebook, period.\\n\\nThe lid has a tasteful Lenovo branding plate on it and a section of the lid has a fine gray hash pattern stenciled on that gives it an interesting and attractive look.\\n\\nThe screen is a matte screen... yes! I\\'ve always been a fan of matte screens (especially on Thinkpads) and although the reviewers complained that it wasn\\'t a bright display, I found it to be just fine in the places I typically use a notebook-type device.\\n\\nThe keyboard isn\\'t the same as that found on Lenovo\\'s other laptops, but it feels stable and quite acceptable for long typing sessions.\\n\\nThe trackpad works well and is consistent.\\n\\nBattery life is extremely good. I haven\\'t run it all the way down yet, but on multiple occasions, I\\'ve run it on battery mostly surfing and typing for 3-4 hours and the projected battery life remaining registered 10+ hours. I don\\'t know how true that is, but I\\'ll try to run it all the way down and update with the results.\\n\\nPerformance is more than adequate. The combination of the Celeron N4020 and the lower screen resolution results in a very smooth and responsive experience.\\n\\nTAKE THE EXPERT REVIEWERS\\' OPINIONS WITH A GRAIN OF SALT\\nBecause expert reviewers have access to a wide variety of devices, (many of them high-end), they can have their perspectives skewed a bit. It\\'s nothing personal against them, it\\'s how we\\'re all wired. That seems to be evident in their review and coverage of the LCB3.\\n\\nLenovo has been \"killing it\" (in a good way) lately in the chromebook space. Their Chromebook Duet gets most of the attention, but this LCB3 is the hidden gem in their recently released chromebooks.\\n\\nI\\'ve owned the older Lenovo ThinkPad chromebooks in the past, but the LCB3 feels more like a ThinkPad than those officially branded ThinkPad chromebooks were. I\\'m baffled as to why expert reviewers haven\\'t given this device more attention.\\n\\nI was initially concerned about how well the few Android apps I rely on would work on a non-touchscreen chromebook, but so far, they work as expected.\\n\\nI\\'m delighted with the LCB3 and it will fit nicely with how I use my chromebooks. I hope this is helpful to those who are considering purchasing the Chromebook 3.',\n",
       " 'This is a very light Chromebook. Easy to carry, very portable.\\n\\nThe product description on Amazon has this Chromebook listed as a \"touchscreen\" Chromebook. If you scroll down to the section titled \"Choose the right Lenovo Chromebook for you\" you will see that this model has a check-mark in the \"Touchscreen\" row. Unfortunately, this Chromebook most certainly does not have a touchscreen. You must use the touch-pad and keyboard for all input.\\n\\nI love that it is quick, and it is very easy to setup. I am happy with its performance. I also love that it has a large drive for storage, long life battery and a very clear display.\\n\\nOverall, I am lukewarm about this Chromebook. To me, the price seems a bit high for a Chromebook with these features. They seriously need to fix the product description. I\\'m giving it 3 stars.',\n",
       " ' I use a Chromebook almost as much as I use an iMac throughout my daily work and play computing activities. I love Chromebooks for their ease of use with a Google Gmail account, their inexpensive price point, and their battery life. But they are not a laptop replacement and rarely have good displays or sound. This Lenovo IdeaPad 3 is no different.\\n\\n➡️ UNBOXING:\\nThe IdeaPad 3 Chromebook is 11.6\" which fit snuggly into the packaging with its AC power supply. There was no wiggling around going on as the Chromebook was securely packaged and arrived unharmed. A small user manual accompanies the device, and the serial number (for registration of the Chromebook) is on the box.\\n\\n➡️ REGISTRATION & WARRANTY:\\nRegistration will require the serial number and your date of purchase, as well as being a registered user on the Lenovo website. Once your device is registered you can see how many days left on your warranty there are - this device comes with a 1-year warranty - and if you send it in for a repair (by mail) the status of the repair.\\n\\n➡️ FIRST IMPRESSIONS:\\nThe compact, 11.6\" size of this Chromebook makes it ideal for students or travelers, particularly those who want to upload photos to the cloud using the micro-SD slot. The plastic case is smooth (no texture) with a matte finish, and fingerprints easily show up on it, but not as easily as they would if it were gloss black.\\n\\nThe keyboard is full-size (no numbers to the side), but there is no backlighting which was a disappointment for me as I do a lot of work at night in low-light conditions. The keyboard is comfortable to type on with very little play or noise when typing. The touchpad is responsive.\\n\\nThe display is technically HD (1366x768 which can be set to 1518 x 853 in the display settings - smaller text, but sharper and my preference), but that doesn\\'t mean it\\'s super-sharp and clear. It isn\\'t. It\\'s washed out and angles dictate what you see and how you see it. This is not a touchscreen.\\n\\nThere is a 720P integrated webcam that provides slightly grainy stills and video, especially in low light. The speakers are downward-facing on either side of the bottom front of the Chromebook, making them easily muffled if the Chromebook is on anything other than a completely flat desktop. (Use a laptop stand where the speakers are not obscured, 3.5mm headphones, or Bluetooth earbuds, or a speaker.)\\n\\nThe AC charger is on par build-wise as the Chromebook itself. With care, both are adequate for daily use.\\n\\nThe Lenovo IdeaPad 3 is a plain-looking, 11.6\" Chromebook with a utilitarian feel. There\\'s nothing that sets it apart in the way that it looks or feels, and while not unexpected, a bit disappointing.\\n\\n--------------------------------------\\n\\n➡️ WHAT I LIKE ABOUT USING THIS CHROMEBOOK:\\n1. It\\'s very lightweight.\\n2. The keyboard is comfortable to use.\\n3. The battery life is excellent! (Averaged 9.5 hours per charge, which took about 2 hours to complete.)\\n4. It works as expected. Easy to set up in less than 5 minutes with a Google Gmail account.\\n5. USB (3.1) ports (2) on both sides of the device.\\n6. 3.5mm headphone jack for wired headphones.\\n7. Latest Bluetooth (4.2) connectivity.\\n8. A microSD card reader slot - a rarity! Allows for easy uploads to the cloud, accessing things like movies on the go from a microSD card, or having additional storage that isn\\'t connected via a USB port.\\n9. USB Type-C ports (2); one on each side - a smart way to add ports (on each side) in my opinion, and not something all manufacturers do.\\n10. 1-Year warranty with mail-in repairs was easy to register on the Lenovo website.\\n11. You can get an external, portable monitor to connect to this Chromebook via USB or USB-C and have two displays.\\n12. Celeron processor with zippy (64GB) drive and 4MB integrated graphics works and plays well together.\\n13. Super-fast setup with Gmail account. Access to G-Suite (Drive, Sheets, etc...), Chrome browser bookmarks, and Google Store apps.\\n\\n➡️ WHAT COULD BE BETTER ABOUT THIS CHROMEBOOK:\\n1. The display is OK, but not great. Turning the size of the text down to the smallest size makes for sharper viewing, but may be uncomfortable for some. You can adjust the size of what you are viewing in the Chrome browser settings, so playing with this may be helpful too. The display has a matte finish and viewing angles really affect the color saturation and clarity.\\n2. The webcam is 720P and it gets the job done, but not well.\\n3. No backlighting behind the keyboard keys. For me, a major disappointment as I often work at night.\\n4. The sound lacks depth and unless you are using earbuds or an external source, it\\'s a little disappointing for watching movies or listening to music.\\n5. No ethernet port - not surprising or expected, but I still like the idea of having one. You can get an adapter (dongle) for USB that will give you one though.\\n\\n------------------------------------\\n\\n🎯 CONCLUSION:\\nThe one thing that this Chromebook has the few have is a micro-SD slot which is great for photographers who want to upload their photos to cloud storage or to access and/or create additional, on-device storage. It\\'s compact and easy to throw into a small bag, and it has up to 10-hour battery life, making it a cheap computer with lots of utilitarian use for those who work in the Google ecosystem.\\n\\nThe lackluster sound and display are disappointing, but not unexpected. They get the job done, but little else. And the display is not a touchscreen, which many around the same price do have.\\n\\nThe bottom line - it\\'s a compact, utilitarian Chromebook that can work for home, office, and travel, but it\\'s nothing special and lacks good speakers, a quality webcam, and a sharp, touchscreen display. It\\'s got the Lenovo brand backing it up with a 1-year, mail-in service warranty.\\n\\nIf you don\\'t mind a black box that just works as expected without many bells and whistles, then this one may be for you.\\n-------------------------------------------\\n\\nUPDATE: Several days on standby have the battery holding steady with no depletion.\\n\\n------------------------------------------',\n",

       " \"I think that this Chromebook from HP brings a lot to the table for under $350, the design is nice despite being mostly plastic. It doesn't have big ugly bezels around the display like the last Chromebook I reviewed. It honestly resembles a Macbook, although many brands are going for this aluminum look with a black keyboard and black around the screen. This is a 2 in 1, so it can flip around and be used solely as a tablet, and it's not too thick to pull this off like many Chromebooks are.\\n\\nChrome OS does have some limitations, but it has matured a lot in the last 5 or so years. You can run android apps from the Google PlayStore, as well as sideloading android apps from the web with a little know-how. You can also setup a Linux VM and install native Linux apps like Libre Office. Of course, most of the Operating System is intended for web based stuff within the Chrome web browser. There is also a new feature to link up your Android phone to Chromebooks, allowing you to receive android notifications on the laptop and be able to send text messages. It also will not lock your laptop while your smartphone is nearby. This is for Android only, iPhones cannot take advantage of these features.\\n\\nChromebooks, by design have less on board storage than a conventional laptop. But this one has 64GB and offers a lot of options for external storage. The port selection is great, 2x USB C ports, 1x USB A port, all 3 ports are 5 gigabit, 3.2 gen 1 (formerly known as USB 3.0) which gives you decently fast transfer speeds. You also get a Micro SD slot and a headphone jack. The two USB C ports are full featured ports, meaning that they support video out, power in, and data. This is great for future proofing. You can charge the laptop on either side thanks to each side having its own port.\\n\\nBattery life is good, I got between 6-9 hours depending on screen brightness and what exactly I was doing on the machine. It supports fast charging and you can recharge the battery to 50% in only 45 minutes. Performance is also good, this laptop has an Intel Pentium Silver N5000. That's a lower end Intel chip, but it's still a decent enough 4 core CPU for a Chromebook. Likewise, the 4GB of RAM is sufficient as well for Chrome OS. Web pages load very quickly with no lag, while using this laptop I haven't been frustrated with poor performance or any kind of jankyness (and I have high standards, I normally use a much more expensive device than this one). In my opinion, this is what makes Chromebooks so appealing- you actually can get a good experience from a laptop that is less than $350 and that just is not true on the windows side (and certainly not on Apple laptops).\\n\\nThe keyboard is good on this laptop, a decent enough key travel that doesn't feel mushy. My typing was as accurate as on my main laptop. I do wish it were backlit, but I will say that about every keyboard that isn't.\\nThe trackpad is one of the better plastic ones that I've used. The finish is smooth and allows for easy scrolling and moving the cursor around. It has a very tactile click that I really enjoy. The speakers are also above average for the price, some laptop speakers in this price range are tinny and have a rattle to them. This has stereo speakers that borders the keyboard on both sides. They have bass to them and are enjoyable to use when watching videos on Youtube or streaming service of choice.\\n\\nNow let's talk about the screen, it's 1366x768 touch screen. That is slightly higher than 720P resolution, it's detailed enough for browsing the web or navigating chrome OS. It would have been nice to seen them include a full HD screen, but they did not. I would say that it's a pretty average laptop screen for the $350 price. It's not amazing, but I think it's good enough for most people. The touch response is good and using this as a tablet is feasible. It will end up being a slightly heavier and thicker tablet than something like an iPad, but it's still thinner than many Chromebooks that offer this functionality.\\n\\nI think that there is a lot here to like from this laptop, if you can live with chrome OS then this will be a great device for you. Just make sure you understand the limitations (of Chrome OS), the laptop is a compelling buy for $340. The only thing about it that I'm not into is the quality of the display, but I think it will be good enough for most, given the overall package.\\n\\nUpdate: This device had no problems on 5Ghz WiFi, wireless performance was good on multiple networks.\\n\\nPros+\\n\\n2 USB C ports that support charging, fast data transfer, and video out to external displays\\n\\nFast 45 watt USB C Power Delivery charging (0-50% in 45 minutes)\\n\\nModern design with smaller bezels and an overall attractive look\\n\\nGood keyboard and trackpad\\n\\nPerformance is snappy thanks to the x86 Intel quad core Gemini lake Pentium Silver N5000\\n\\nSpeakers actually sound good\\n\\nCons-\\n\\nScreen is not Full HD (1080P) and the colors look a little washed out or faded\",\n",

This is being used as a casual family room PC.\\n\\nFirst of all, the HP hardware is pretty darn good for the price at which this device sells for. It's a very clean design and feels pretty sturdy if held by one hand. I've had more expensive laptops feel like they were going to break if held in the same way. I would say the keyboard is on par of other laptops in this price range. One complaint that I have is the sharp edge where you'd place your palms while typing. I would have preferred it was a little more rounded out, but it's not a game changer. I'll have to see what it's like over the long term.\\n\\nThe screen is also very similar to screens at this price. Not the greatest of viewing angles, but has excellent touch response. The viewing angles only become a problem if/when you use as a tablet. Speaking of which, I love that the screen folds all the way back so that it can be used as a tablet. That's a great feature and I wish all laptops were capable of doing that.\\n\\nBattery life seems to be really great. I'm able to use this on and off over 2 or 3 days without a charge. This is really with regular web browsing, so no movies/music to really drain the battery.\\n\\nFinally, Chrome OS is very simple and lightweight. I like how some web apps appear as installed applications as opposed to web pages in the Chrome web browser. I've also enabled the Linux beta VM, which has allowed me to install the Brave web browser. I prefer that over Chrome for it's safety and ad-blocking features. It's seems to work just fine, although it may be a bit slower then Chrome.\\n\\nSo far, I'm incredibly pleased with this Chromebook. I feel it offers a great value and an experience that is better then I expected. Highly recommended!\",\n",
       " 'The screen had a defect out of the box. It seemed like a nice laptop but the screen quality appeared to be poor. Moving it different angles the screen looked awful. This is not good consider this is a convertible and using in multiple positions is the point.',\n",

I love how spacious and comfortable it is.\\n\\nPros:\\n- high quality material (haven't tested whether it's water resistant yet)\\n- very roomy\\n- can adjust to bigger size if needed\\n- LOTS of pockets\\n- bottom zipped off compartment for shoes!!, wet clothes, or lunch!\\n- well compartmentalized to keep items organized\\n\\nCons:\\n- None that I've discovered so far.

       " \"I wanted this backpack to carry my work shoes, lunch and purse all at the same time without causing an undue strain on my shoulders after having surgery. This fit the bill. It's lightweight and durable enough, has a separate space for the shoes, an inside zippered compartment along with a couple of extra zippered pockets on the outside. I like the antitheft feature with the space to carry your phone or passport on the backside close to your body, as well as the roll down top. There is a strap that buckles across your chest to keep the shoulder straps positioned correctly and to keep from sliding off. I suppose the shoulder straps could be a little more padded for more comfort, but my commute is not that long and with a winter coat on, I haven't noticed any difficulty. This is an excellent product at an affordable price.\",\n",
       " \"Bought the bag for my motorcycle. It is truly waterproof. I can fit my roland sands fresno shoes at the bottom which are big. For the price you can't go wrong, it looks cool, can put my laptop with no problem and the materials seems built to last. Overall it is a solid backpack.\\n\\nUpdate: After riding for 3 hours in heavy rain the waterproof was gone and started to lick inside, thank god I didn't have a laptop or cellphone in the bag. From now on I will keep electronics in a plastic bag just to make sure. It holds rain up to 1 hour I guess, after that better take cover or put a cover on the backpack\",\n",
       " 'This time, the belt actually conforms to my body shape and is very comfortable. Most backpacks will stick into my skin and cause injury. Very spacious interior, although maybe another or two inner bags will be good. However, there is nothing to complain about! I like the overall design, making it a very attractive package, just like its function. I like this design, especially the charging and earplug connection. The only thing that can be improved is the lock itself. This is a very good backpack, and I like it very much! Recommend! !',\n",

       " \"As many parents are home schooling or online schooling it has become a little hard to find a place to keep our children's laptops or tablets in a good position. This is especially hard for smaller children. This laptop stand is very handy as you can place a laptop/tablet on it to get the perfect position. You can adjust the height and the angle that best suits you or your child. It has a space so the device can remain cool and not heat up. I love that I can move it around which has made it a lot more fun for my child to sit outside in a table and enjoy his class sessions outside. It can be very difficult having the tablets not have a sturdy place to be placed on without falling over and potentially breaking. This has been so convenient! We love that he can adjust the height and even work stading up to stretch our legs. You don't have to be crouching to look at your device. I have also used it to hold our tablet while we cook and watch tutorials online. It is not heavy at all and comes with a storage bag. Lays down flat for easy storage. Highly recommend this very useful laptop stand!\",\n",
       " 'This met all my expectations! I was worried it would be wobbly but it’s actually really sturdy. I have a MacBook Pro 13in, so it’s heavier than most laptops, and it fits nicely. Like some other reviews have said, it’s hard to pry it apart to get it to the right height. But after some wiggling and straining I did. It actually made me feel good that I had to struggle with it because that meant it was tight enough to stay in place. It doesn’t really jiggle when I type on the laptop while it’s in the stand, but I normally use a separate keyboard so I can’t say for certain it won’t shake when you’re using it. One thing I really like is that the two tabs on the front that hold the computer in place are spaced apart. I looked at a few that just had a bar in the middle but that would have made it difficult to get to the groove in my laptop where I open it. Since the two tabs are spaced apart I can easily open the laptop without moving it. So, I’m conclusion, this is a really good stand that does exactly what I need it to do. It looks professional (not cheap) and is sturdy. I’d recommend it.',\n",
       " 'This is the best laptop stand in my book. It is incredibly lightweight, sturdy in that it can support my 14 inch laptop as well as my partners 15.6 laptop. In addition it has 4 padded non slip silicone or rubber round pads as well as two added raised padded lips in front making your even a large laptop slip proof. My cooling device in back even fits great which is a plus. I have tried three other stands and returned them all. This one is perfect and it adjusts easily and stays secure and tight. It Can support adjust steeper and hold more weight than most, I can even lean on it. Thank you.',\n",

Facilitates work at the table, for greater comfort and position when using it to avoid neck pain. Ideal to give to a family member or friend.',\n",
       " 'This stand feels super sturdy. It definitely doesn’t move around at all when your computer is on it. It also adjusts nice and high if (like me) you’re trying to raise your webcam for video calls. The color is really cute and there are grips to keep your computer from sliding around. You can adjust both the height and angle of the stand which is nice for different kinds of work. Adjusting it can be a little bit of a wrestling match, but it really stays in place when you have it where you want it.',\n",
       " 'This stand looks nice (I got the silver) and is very sturdy - fits my 15\" laptop nicely. Yes you do have to exert a fair amount of pressure to move it up and down, as others have noted, but it needs to be like that in order to keep it stable at various heights. So far so good, it freed up room on my desk and made it much easier to set my laptop higher for video calls rather than having to look down into the camera (Double Chin Central).',\n",
       " 'This laptop stand is made of quality aluminum which is quite stiff and will support 44 lbs. I don\\'t expect my HP Spectre laptop will ever break it. What I like about the stand is that it has a lot of vent holes through the base that allows considerable air flow to disapate the heat and keep the machine cooler. The HP has vents and a small fan to help the computer cooler, however, when you lay it on a flat surface ther is not much space for air to flow to keep the machine cool. This stand lets you raise the base above the surface nearly 1.5\" up to about 9\" . The screen obviouslly is higher so you can see it while standing perhaps reading a book or recipies while cooking. At lower levels the base is adjustable to make typing angles more comfortable. My laptop seems very secure in this stand and it has allowed my HP to run cooler but has provided a more comfortable position for me to spend my time on.\\nNice Stand. Good product overall. I would buy again or give as gift.',\n",
       " \"This is such a stand for your laptop and or tablet. It is so strong and very well built. It looks much more expensive than the price it's selling for. I definitely recommend this product, especially since most children are doing school online. This has helped my kids alot at home, since we can't buy a desk for each of them. With this stand they can sit at the dinner table or kitchen counter, and it's works very well.\",\n",
       " 'I bought this laptop for light audio work and general use on Linux and it really blew me away. Is it a $700, $800 laptop? Absolutely not, but if you need a good laptop that CAN charge with USB-C PD, has good battery life (5-12hrs depending on how hard it\\'s pushed and if it\\'s using Linux or Windows), and a beautiful display, this is the computer for you. The quad core processor is actually a pretty decent little chip but while it beats out the Celeron N series chips in most budget laptops, it obviously doesn\\'t hold a candle to a core i5 or Ryzen 3 laptop. If your use case doesn\\'t require a lot of CPU or GPU, this is a fantastic laptop and nothing comes close to it in price.\\n\\nIt is a pretty good Windows laptop and has no issues with anything except lots of Chrome tabs but Firefox works really well with the modest specs of this laptop. I installed Pop!_OS Linux after a few days and the difference was pretty impressive. Battery life went up by about 20-50% depending on the workload and CPU usage was also lower when idling or doing light tasks.\\n\\nThe BIOS can be hard to find but pressing the delete or escape key on startup will put you in the menu and for those interested in installing Linux, you\\'ll want to go to the south bridge (yes it has a south bridge) settings to change the OS it\\'s looking for from Windows to Linux.\\n\\nThe screen is obviously the star of the show here and it is truly amazing, especially in the 3:2 aspect ratio but I\\'m going to focus on some other aspects that may be less clear. The top of the laptop, i.e. behind the display is aluminum and feels pretty sturdy but the rest of the body is made of plastic. I\\'m usually not a fan of plastic but it\\'s color matched well and feels almost as good as the aluminum while doing a better job of keeping the bits you touch from getting hot when the laptop is really working.\\n\\nThe touchpad is plastic but it is definitely on the larger side, large enough that there is no room for a single complaint about it not being big enough. The first few days it feels a bit rough but after that the touchpad becomes quite smooth and nice to use so when you first try to use it and your finger bounces across the surface, don\\'t worry it\\'ll get better. The left and right click buttons are integrated under the touchpad so you press on the bottom of the touchpad and it\\'ll click I\\'d you don\\'t like the one/two finger click style.\\n\\nThe keyboard is also plastic and while it\\'s not amazing, it feels like a $500-$600 laptop keyboard, not like a bottom of the barrel keyboard. A big part of what gives it that good feel is the tactility. It has a good amount of key travel, probably a bit more than average for a laptop and the keys don\\'t feel totally mushy. They have a travel to them that allows you to feel when a key has been pressed, it\\'s not totally linear as it has what I would describe as a miniscule drop at the bottom of the press that helps you feel when something is pressed. The keys can shift a little with sideways force but it\\'s certainly not the worst I\\'ve felt and definitely fine considering the $349.99 price point I purchased it at.\\n\\nThe RAM and storage are well more than enough to get you off the ground and it even has an M.2 2280 extension bay that I have yet to test but I\\'ll try to update the review when I do so I can confirm if it works with NVMe or just SATA M.2 drives. (I tried an NVMe 1TB WD Green 2280 and Linux was unable to recognize it in the computer though the slot technically fits an NVMe. Not sure if it would work with Windows.) Note: the built-in storage is a SATA-III SSD, not NVMe though I wouldn\\'t expect it at this price and not the much slower eMMC storage many budget laptops unfortunately use. Also, I have yet to use more than 4.5GB RAM at a time so 12 is definitely overkill for this class of laptop (I did hit 6.2GB in Windows once).\\n\\nThe speakers... This is where some of the high praises are no longer that high although with an asking price this low, corners have to be cut somewhere. The stereo speakers are far from awful however they border \"decent\" and \"alright\". They fire from holes on the bottom of the laptop and get muffled if it\\'s on your lap. They do get recently loud and you can at least hear a tiny hint of bass so I\\'ll give them that. The headphone jack reveals that headphone listening is actually pretty good. I am an audiophile with decent but not crazy hardware and the on board dac does well enough that I don\\'t have any complaints though the audio gets a bit thin in the higher frequencies. The high notes don\\'t sound bad, there\\'s just a noticeable lack of some detail. I\\'ve heard audio from PC motherboards over half the price of this laptop that sound a good bit worse than what the audio jack on this laptop has to offer though so 9/10 there, great job Chuwi!\\n\\nThe fan on this laptop (it does have one) maxes out at 26-27 or so DBA which means a lightly whispered conversation will drown out the fans at full speed. I\\'ve only seen the fans kick on two times and both times, I was hammering the CPU and GPU at the same time for hours on end so while it technically has a fan, it\\'s super quiet, so quiet it\\'s basically fanless. At full tilt for hours on end the chassis right under the fan gets warm enough to be noticeable but the rest of the laptop stays impressively cool to the touch. I use my laptop on the go very often and it never gets warm enough to notice even when on my lap for long periods of time and that is a huge plus in my book.\\n\\nThe webcam is an 0.3MP unit so everything looks super soft and really, really bad. Like 2012 budget Android phone bad. This is NOT for video calls, this will look absolutely atrocious on any video calling platform. PLEASE do not use this for Zoom! Get a USB webcam. The camera is only there to tick the box on the spec sheet.\\n\\nThe hinge: I had actually heard some conflicting things about the build of the hinge when researching this laptop so I\\'ll try to clear things up a bit. The long, centered hinge is also made of plastic by the way and while it\\'s not super sturdy, it doesn\\'t feel like it\\'ll break too easily. That said I would still open and close it at a reasonable speed and not slam it shut because obviously it is still a budget laptop but overall it\\'s a good hinge.\\n\\nAnd that\\'s all I got! Hopefully this review was of some help to you and if so, please hit the \"Helpful\" button. I\\'ll continue to update this review as I use the laptop more. This review is currently based on 1 month of ownership.',\n",
       " 'Absolutely the best screen on any laptop even close to this price range (it uses the same panel as the Huawei Matebook 13 which literally costs 3 times as much). I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the rest of the laptop as well, sturdy aluminum/plastic shell, a very useable keyboard, and a decent webcam with optimal placement at the top of the screen. The storage and RAM are excellently sized for the price as well. The processor is not very powerful for a modern machine but definitely snappy enough for web browsing and word processing; it is MILES better than the Celeron N3350 in my old netbook which originally retailed for the same $350 price tag.\\n\\nOne issue with the laptop and I notice a few questions about it above - the laptop comes with Windows 10 but it it does NOT come with a valid activation key - see pictures. It seems that as a cost-cutting measure, CHUWI is using the same Windows key on many different laptop installations, which invalidates the activation.\\n\\nYou will still be able to use Windows as normal except for some personalization options, such as setting your own desktop wallpaper. There will also constantly be an \"Activate Windows\" watermark in the bottom right corner of your screen which can be mildly annoying. I am willing to live with it but I wish CHUWI was more forthcoming about this drawback to an otherwise fantastic budget laptop.',\n",
       " 'When I received first one, my initial impression was it seemed to be a lot of computer for the price. Screen was okay - had some light bleed around edges, but color and brightness were good. Keyboard felt good, typing was easy. But back light timed out quickly, and had to touch a key to bring back on, and no way I found to change that setting. Performance was slow, but to be expected with the hardware components used.\\nHowever, there were major software issues. First, I could not get windows mail to work, even with updates, re-installing mail, etc. So after online research and finding no answers, tried resetting laptop. What a mess that made - when the computer finished resetting, only 1/4 of programs were re-installed. Only a few Windows programs, and nothing else.\\nDecided to return and exchange for another. When I received second one, all went well at first, and I thought it would be a winner. Everything went well, and even did a reset to make sure all worked properly. Spent a couple days getting everything setup, and finally sat back to watch Netflix, using blue tooth sound through my receiver. The blue tooth sound started \"cutting in and out\", making watching a movie impossible. Then tried mp music stored in computer - same results. Evidently a bad blue tooth card, or driver, but with all the different issues, I gave up and returned this one as well.\\nI think that with a little more work and QC, these laptops can be a good choice, but right now they seem to be plagued with problems.',\n",

I could see how it might have been easily thrown away with the rest of the packaging.\\n\\nPROS:\\n- thin, lightweight, sleek design\\n- no logo on the outside\\n- full keyboard and typing feels nice\\n- fast processing\\n- comes with windows 10 already installed\\n- quiet, doesn’t make noise (I read that it is fanless)\\n- caps lock has a light that turns on when caps in on! same with num lock\\n\\nCONS:\\n- logo is ugly, but it’s only on the inside\\n- screen itself is not glossy\\n- only comes with the online version of Microsoft office (luckily I can download them through my school for free)\\n- speakers are just ok, but I like to use my Bluetooth ear phones anyways\\n\\nI will update as more time passes to see how it really is after a month or so of moderate to heavy use!',\n",
       " 'I was a bit weary because there were no reviews for this laptop when I bought it. This laptop is truly impressive! It feels like a very nice metal and has a good weight to it. Very good quality feel too it. It performs nice and zippy and is half the cost of other brand names. The keyboard is very nice and the overall build of this laptop is very smooth. The screen is nice and vivid. The only thing I can’t seem to figure out how to work is the “backlit keyboard” though. There is no button to turn it on and no setting in windows. Maybe it doesn’t have a backlit keyboard? I docked a star because it says everywhere that it has a lit keyboard but it really doesn’t and I was a bit disappointed.\\n\\nOtherwise this was a great purchase. Perfect for what I need it for which is simple word processing and web surfing.\\n\\nDefinitely recommend this laptop if you don’t care about brand names.',\n",
       " 'This laptop had just come out & I had just found it in the search results when looking for my @73 year old Daddy who’s not real tech savvy a laptop he wanted to start using instead of being tied down to a desktop & the desktop is like 20 years old but I upgraded it & built it to last the test of time. This laptop came in a box that was just an Amazon prime box that arose no suspicion that it was a high end electronic device & after getting off the front porch & taking it to my Daddy he actually opened the laptop, found the power button, even tho the laptop was initially on when he lifted the lid the first time & in no time he was online & surfing the Internet & signing onto his sites with his saved passwords sheets & even had the Windows 10 updated & had the computer rocking. He showed me how some stuff worked instead of me having to show him cuz he said this particular computer laptop just made everything easy to get started up, it was as advertised with a huge amount of RAM & ROM & had a brilliantly bright screen that I’d head others still was dull. My Daddy couldn’t believe I got him this brand new 2021 laptop for less than $350 & to get a laptop so loaded with specs & great components like so much RAM, ROM, & a bigger than usual 256GB SSD Hard Drive & all the ports he could ever want with a keypad that was so flawless in its working & so sensitive to touch & made just right that my Dad won’t ever need a mouse to get moved around the screen like he thought either. This is one of the best laptops you’re gonna get cuz it’s lightning fast all the way around, from loading to shutting down to updating to surfing to streaming to watching or playing huge GB movies or games & it loads anything online videos & game streamings just as fast as it loads a downloaded program or app from a website or the Microsoft Store App with Windows 10 Professional, which is a great operating system period! Just using the SSD hard drive when you pull up programs on the W10 Professional operating system, & my Daddy never having an SSD hard drive before can already tell the difference & still can’t believe he got this most awesome of laptops, especially when he knew it was a brand new 2021 model & not a refurbished or a renewed open box laptop & that it came with a pretty fast processor from the biggest brand name processor chip producer in the world, Intel! All I know is this company who produced this laptop may be new kids on the block but they sure understand the phrase quality at a great reasonable price cuz this laptop should’ve cost all of $600 or more just because of the laptops specs & speed, cause it’s faster than any MSI or Alienware Gaming PC or laptop I’ve used before & it even has a bigger screen than most higher costing laptops of smaller 14” or less screen sizes. II don’t know how this company is gonna be able to keep up with the demand to buy one once folk find these laptops on Amazon when you consider all these high end performing components that are from some of the highest rated electronic & computer part company manufactures in the world, & to still get it for a ridiculously low price when it has all those brand name components & high end PC specs & I mean game PC kind of specs for a laptop at this given price!!! My Daddy’s completely satisfied with it & he & my Mama’s compliments on the laptop has got me wanting to get one of them instead of building me another laptop component by component & putting it together myself just cuz it comes so loaded & with Win10 Professional & it’s all visible on a regular sized 15.6” beautifully colored & bright sized screen & it’s still lightweight with no fans to cool down hard drive making it weigh less than 3 pounds & that regular screen makes online video watching easier than the 11,12,13, or 14” Amazon, Apple, & Google like tablets, net books, or small app running netbook from schools that function as our school kids’ laptops or PC’s, even though those raggedy things were bought years ago & never refurbished or renewed, just cleaned programs off & redistributed the following year after librarians said they’d keep the books like brand new & always fix & refurbish the component parts if necessary.',\n",

       " \"I bought this laptop for college, being a freshman I was looking for something affordable that would last. I got the core i5 10th gen and I am absolutely happy with my purchase. I had thought about getting a mac but price wise it was out of range. The pavilion is very smooth and crisp in a way. I use it for online class and I have to run some programs for my science classes. It has NOT let me down. I've been using it for about a month now and it still works like new. The setup took me like 15 minutes when I first got it. The only things that I believe could be a con for some is that the battery will not last a whole day. I start class at around 8:20 am and around 12 pm the battery is dead, there is a battery saver button tho and it usually let's my battery last an extra hour or so. Tablet mode is fun, I don't usually use it so I have no comment on that. Regardless, very good product for the price. Would 100% recommend for college students. I don't think this would be a good choice for gaming tho. (sorry for the stickers!)\\n\\nEdit: it has been almost a year since I bought this laptop. It's very sturdy tho it seems light, I've dropped it a few times and it doesn't have a scratch on it. I take it with me on my backpack (usually besides my tennis racket) again, no dents or scratches. I dropped water on it too a few times, works like new (not saying that it is waterproof, maybe I was lucky) but very strong overall. I've taken a few coding classes that include python, HTML, and CSS and it runs it with no problem. It is very fast, very very fast, personally I keep photos, music, documents and such in an USB which leaves my laptop pretty empty so it could be because of that. Camera is pretty good, gets you through zoom, speakers are good as well. Overall, a year later and I still think this laptop is a 5/5.\",\n",
       " 'HP Pavilion x360 14-inch 2-in-1 Convertible Laptop, Intel Core i5, 8 GB RAM, 512 GB SSD Storage, Intel UHD Graphics, Windows 10 Home, Amazon Alexa Voice Compatible (14-dh2011nr, Natural Silver)\\n\\nLook and Feel\\nWith the exception of the hinges, the laptop shell is entirely made of plastic. The finish on the top (opposite the screen) is painted to mimic the look of brushed aluminum. It looks pretty convincing whilst it\\'s new but I expect that as it gets scratched over the course of its lifetime it will be very obvious even from a distance that it\\'s just painted plastic.\\n\\nThe hinge is very nicely designed, moves smoothly and holds sturdily. There\\'s no wiggle or play, it\\'s just very solid.\\n\\nThe whole thing weighs in at 3 lb 9 oz. not counting the power adapter.\\n\\nKeyboard\\nThe keyboard layout is comfortable and doesn\\'t have any unusual key placement or size. This may not seem noteworthy if you\\'ve never used a laptop that did something strange with the keyboard (I\\'m looking at you Lenovo), but trust me, it matters.\\n\\nAnother nice thing about a fairly standardized keyboard layout is the ready availability of keyboard covers. Although this model is not specifically listed as compatible, this cover fits perfectly: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B076KKYXXR. I\\'ve had more than one device saved by silicone keyboard covers like this and I strongly recommend them for anyone buying one of these. (I\\'m not recommending any cover specifically, merely providing an example of one that perfectly fits. This way you can take the model numbers from that listing and look for others if you like)\\n\\nThe keys themselves are well-designed low-profile keys. They\\'re quiet and responsive. I don\\'t have any problems with bounce and the (mostly) full-width keys are still comfortable under my large hands.\\n\\nThe keyboard backlight is very well designed. Each of the keys including its alternate function (punction etc...) are illuminated cleanly. There are three backlight levels, though I find the lower intensity unnecessary as the default setting is bright enough to see in a brightly lit room and not overpowering in a dark room.\\n\\nTouchpad\\nThe touchpad is basically standard fare. It\\'s designed well enough that I didn\\'t find myself accidentally moving the mouse pointer while typing. Though I still prefer a USB mouse, the touchpad is very serviceable.\\n\\nDisplay\\nThe screen is extremely glossy and will reflect absolute anything remotely bright behind you. It\\'s not terribly noticeable when you\\'re working with bright/white content on the screen - such as in a word processor or reading most web pages, but when there is darker content on the screen as often happens when watching videos it\\'s surface becomes like a mirror. That didn\\'t seem like a good design choice to me but maybe having a mirror finish is necessary because it\\'s a touch-screen?\\n\\nThe edge-lit IPS does offer a bright and clear image, though it\\'s not as bright as I would like. Since I don\\'t have a reliable method for measuring nits my evaluation of its brightness is going to be subjective. In summer noontime daylight it\\'s noticeably dimmer than other 300 nit screens I have tested, though it is still somewhat readable if you stay in the shade so I would guestimate it\\'s brightness between 230 and 250 nits. I would consider this screen as being mostly for indoor use though, as I said, it is marginally usable outdoors on a sunny day provided you have ample shade. If used in a darker environment the screen is bright but does suffer from typical LCD uniformity problems (see the image of a blank screen attached to this review).\\n\\nThe refresh rate of the display seems to be locked at 59Hz. Being an IPS screen it has very fast switching so it passed the blur-busters tests just fine - motion blur is all but non-existent making it great for watching video.\\n\\nThe capacitive touch screen is very responsive and feels accurate even with my giant fingers. I don\\'t have a stylus to test so I can\\'t comment on compatibility or accuracy of that.\\n\\nReal-Life Windows 10 (Not S Mode!)\\nA lot of this 2-in-1 style of laptop come with an operating system called “Windows 10 Home in S Mode”. “S Mode” is a highly limited implementation of Windows 10 that only allows you to use the Edge browser and only allows you to run software from the Microsoft App Store. The inclusion of “S Mode” rather than a real-life Windows 10 is usually an indication that the vendor was not confident that the hardware provided would actually be able to run Windows 10. Thankfully this laptop comes with a fully enabled implementation of Windows 10 Home and in my testing it performed just fine.\\n\\nIncluded Software\\nWhat would setting up a new machine be without going through and removing all of the pre-loaded garbage vendors always like to cram in? This machine comes with a pretty standard complement of bloatware, “free trial” and offer software. In case those terms don\\'t mean anything to you, it basically referrs to apps that are more about getting you on the hook for paying fees for services than they are about increasing your productivity.\\n\\nSome of the trialware/offerware is built in to Windows 10 itself, some of it comes from HP. I can\\'t really provide a comprehensive list of what I think you should immediately remove from this laptop upon powering it up, but I will recommend two that you should immediately get rid of. First is McAfee LiveSafe which is a waste of space that will soak up resources without actually protecting your computer then expire in a year or six months or whenever and beg for more money. Just uninstall it and reboot – your machine will automatically switch to the built-in Windows Defender anti-malware which is free with Windows, won\\'t kill your battery and actually does a much better job stopping and cleaning malware. The second thing I recommend you immediately get rid of is “WildTangent Games”. You\\'ll need to remove both the “App” and the installed program to get rid of it entirely. I\\'m deeply disappointed that HP thinks so little of its customers that it would ship this machine with WildTangent Games pre-installed. During my days as a PC tech WildTangent Games were a universally despised vehicle for spyware.\\n\\nThere were quite a few other things I removed right away like Express VPN, Dropbox Offer, Microsoft Office etc... If you don\\'t remove these they will periodically pop up and annoy you by either trying to talk you or scare you into signing up for new services. If you want cloud-based backup signing up for a Microsoft Account gets you some free “OneDrive” space and if you need more it\\'s worth paying for it – you don\\'t need both Dropbox and OneDrive. The Microsoft Office stuff gives you minimal access to Microsoft Word and tries to get you to sign up for paid services to get the rest. I switched to OpenOffice years ago and have never looked back. If you need a VPN service and don\\'t already have one, I suggest you shop around a little rather than just go for Express VPN. But I digress. I strongly recommend you go through the installed “Apps” and remove anything that says “Offer” next to it.\\n\\nConvertible / 2-in-1 features\\nThe ability to use the “convertible” features was the thing that most attracted me to this machine. I enjoy watching movies without having to be tethered to any particular room (and when traveling)\\n\\nLaptop Mode\\nIn laptop mode this is just like any other slim-line laptop. This configuration offers the best/clearest sound as the speakers fire up from the far side of the keyboard, and the best overall ergonomics.\\n\\nTent Mode\\nIn Tent Mode the laptop is folded into an upside-down V shape and propped up on a surface. This is by far my favorite mode for watching movies and TV with this machine, but it does come with extra considerations. In this mode the speakers are pointed away from you, though in my testing I was still able to hear things just fine. It would have been nice if they had included some silicone or rubber bumpers on the edge to keep the laptop from slipping or to keep rough surfaces from scuffing up the edge of laptop itself.\\n\\nTablet Mode\\nTablet mode is a bit of a mixed bag. Essentially you fold the laptop closed backwards with the keyboard and screen on the outside. The keyboard is disabled in this mode. While you can use this laptop sort of like you would a tablet, its extra bulk is a definite factor. The larger difficulty I had, however, was in holding it in a way that did not result in accidentally activating some control or scrolling to the bottom of a page because my fingers tickled the edge of the touch screen. Switching to \"Tablet Mode\" in Windows 10 did very little to alleviate this. Also in tablet mode it\\'s difficult to adjust the screen brightness or volume. I think this mode would be much better if they would provide volume and brightness controls on the edge of the machine and some software adjustment to move controls away from the edges where you\\'re likely to accidently activate them while just trying to hold the \"tablet\" in place.\\n\\nSpeakers\\nMuch is made of the \"Audio by Bang and Olufsen\". For such small speakers they do sound remarkably clear and present a wider dynamic range than I would expect, but that being said don\\'t expect miracles. I had to max out the volume in a couple of instances while watching shows in tent mode and even then it did not sound particularly loud.\\n\\nBattery Life\\nWithout trying to apply any scientific process to judge battery life, I noted while using it that I was able to get about 4-5 hours out of a charge when just browsing the web, watching the occasional YouTube video and writing in a word processor. It was only about 2.5 to 3 hours while watching Netflix or other videos at full brightness. At 3470mAh the capacity isn\\'t terribly impressive, but for such a lightweight system it seems just right.\\n\\nWiFi speed\\nThe multi-function Wi-Fi and Bluetooth in one chip provided with this laptop provides thoroughly average performance. In practice I was able to get transfer speeds of almost 10MB/s (Bytes not bits), which is more than enough for most day-to day activities, but doesn\\'t come close to the performance tuned chips in some of the other laptops I\\'ve reviewed, some of which were able to more than double that throughput. Again, I don\\'t consider this a drawback because it provides perfectly adequate performance for general purpose computing.\\n\\nWebcam / Microphone\\nThe built in webcam is very generic with a 720x1280 sensor. Like most generic webcams, it has a very low ISO sensitivity and therefore requires a decent amount of ambient light to show a clear picture. In a darker environment the image becomes grainy and video smears as the camera tries to compensate for low light. I wouldn\\'t try to record for YouTube on it, but it\\'s perfectly serviceable for web conferencing as long as you\\'re in a well-lit room.\\n\\nThe built-in microphone on the other hand actually sounds pretty good, picking up voice clean and clear. The documentation doesn\\'t say for sure, but it\\'s possible the mic was also designed by B&O. In any case I think they did a terrific job for a built-in mic.\\n\\nStorage\\nOne of the things I look for in a laptop is the ability to upgrade the primary storage. In general if you see \"eMMC\" listed on the description it means that the primary storage (i.e. hard drive) is soldered in and is generally more trouble than it\\'s worth to swap out. I\\'m happy to report that this laptop actually has full M.2 NVMe SSD which can, if the need arises, be replaced with a larger capacity drive, though the 512GB drive it ships with is plenty big for my needs. This laptop was clearly not designed to be upgraded or serviced by end users as evidenced by how annoying they made it to take apart, but once I had the back off it looks like it was designed to incorporate a full SATA SSD as well with a spot carved out under the right palm rest and an unpopulated ribbon socket labeled \"HDD1\". I could not find any documentation on this (as of the time of this review), so I\\'m not sure if it\\'s an either-or where you have to pick one or the other or if you can use both a SATA and M.2 drive at the same time. I was unable to test this because I don\\'t have the proprietary adapter to connect the drive to the board.\\n\\nThe supplied 512GB NVMe drive perfomed adequately but maxed out at ~1GB/s writes and ~1.5GB/s reads. This is somewhat normal for a budget drive but about half the potential of the NVMe spec. As it would have involved re-installing Windows 10, I did not wish to try out a faster NVMe drive to see if the limitation lies with the drive itself or the controller. Since you\\'re not going to be gaming on this laptop, the drive speeds are absolutely fine.\\n\\nCPU/GPU Performance / Throttling\\nSo does this laptop throttle the CPU? While my default is to assume that it throttles the CPU/GPU until proven otherwise, most of my attempts to verify one way or the other have been stymied by the unavailability of system hooks used by the Intel XTU (which flat out refuses to install) or MSI Afterburner (installs but can\\'t actually see anything). With a base frequency of 1GHz the machine runs pretty cool most of the time. The fan isn\\'t really capable of moving much heat so I seriously doubt that you will ever see a \"burst\" to 3.6GHz, but again unless you\\'re trying to game on this machine that\\'s largely immaterial.\\n\\nIn my testing what games I was able to get running ran reasonably well at medium to high settings - older games ran fine at high settings, newer ones needed to be dialed back. Even though this isn\\'t a gaming machine it\\'s a good indication of what its capable of.\\n\\nI had no trouble editing large images with GIMP, including computationally complex operations such as perspective shift and de-noise algorithms.\\n\\nThe full-sized HDMI port makes it easy to connect a second monitor up to 4k@60 (it will default to 4k@30, but can be switched to 60Hz and in my testing works without any issues). Likewise it was able to render web pages and video in 4K just as smoothly as it did in 1080p.\\n\\nGaming\\nThis isn\\'t a gaming laptop – which is probably obvious to anyone reading this, but even the most businesslike user may be tempted to dabble now and again. I had considerable trouble getting games to run reliably on this. Most titles crashed to desktop after one to five minutes without so much as a helpful error message. What I did have some luck with were older titles like BioShock, Deus Ex Human Revolution etc...\\n\\nWatching Video\\nFor video playback I tested a variety of scenarios. Playback of H265 10-bit 4K (HDMI Outputs 4K) content was basically smooth and flawless as was Blu-ray playback via VLC and libaacs. Both YouTube and Netflix had occasional stuttering on 1080p content but I\\'m being very nit-picky. If I was not paying specific attention to how smooth playback was I would probably not have noticed.\\n\\nMiscellaneous\\n- Unfortunately the 14-dh2011nr doesn\\'t support Power Delivery which means that it can\\'t be charged via the USB-C port like some of the higher-end x360\\'s can. In my opinion this is a huge missed opportunity as the ability to charge via USB-C makes it easier to purchase extra power adapters (one for home one for the office, etc...) and opens up the possibility of extending runtime while traveling by using a large power bank that supports PD.\\n- Had to use compatibility mode to get certain apps (OpenOffice) to properly scale fonts etc... This is generally caused by the display drivers not being full featured enough to support the DPI mode being set from the app.\\n- Like most laptop power adapters, there is no obvious way to wrap the cord to minimize the space it takes up inside your bag.\\n- The USB ports had no trouble delivering enough power to power external spinning hard drives and optical drives without needing to use a second power source. This also means that if you use this laptop\\'s ports to charge other devices over USB they may charge faster if the device is designed to take advantage of higher-amperage power sources.\\n\\nConclusion:\\n\\nThe 14-dh2011nr isn\\'t the most powerful, doesn\\'t have the brightest screen, isn\\'t the fastest, but it has all around great features and performance for this price range. It\\'s perfect for surfing the web, web conferencing, editing photos, and watching movies or shows. It\\'s one of the best priced 2-in-1 laptops I\\'ve seen that\\'s capable of running full-blown Windows 10 Home and doesn\\'t feel sluggish in the slightest. It\\'s quiet, has good battery life, lightweight and an all around pleasure to use. In short it\\'s exactly what I was looking for.\\n\\nPros:\\n- Lightweight and thin\\n- Full-sized standard keyboard (compatible with available keyboard covers)\\n- Full-sized HDMI socket - supports 4K@60 just fine\\n- Full Windows 10 Home (NOT \"S Mode\")\\n- Good battery life\\n- Convertable has great options for watching video or working without a keyboard\\n- Quiet fan - even going full blast it\\'s barely above a whisper\\n- Decent amount of storage - 512GB\\n- Legit M.2 drive (so it\\'s upgradeable)\\n- Great built-in mic\\n- The full-sized USB 3.0 ports deliver enough amperage to support power-hungry devices like external hard drives and external DVD/Blu-ray drives\\n\\nCons:\\n- Shiny reflective screen surface can be really distracting (mostly during dark scenes in videos)\\n- No \"bumpers\" or rubber feet to protect the edge and stop slipping in Tent Mode\\n- Screen is only around ~240 nits makes it only marginally usable in daylight - this is really an indoor screen\\n- Pre-loaded with bloatware/nagware software including the spyware \"WildTangent Games\"\\n\\nNeutral Observations:\\n- Can\\'t really game on it (newer titles seem to run okay but almost all of them crash out in the first minute)\\n- Tablet mode is novel but difficult to use because controls are on the edge where you\\'re holding your fingers\\n- The GPU is extremely basic and lacks any options for monitoring\\n- The CPU lacks the normal system hooks for monitoring',\n",

The keys are backlit (which can be turned on and off with the press of a button), and there are ports for virtually everything you could imagine. The screen itself is somewhat of a matte texture which is something I\\'m not used to, but after a few hours of use I appreciated how it prevents glare. As with most laptops, the brightness is adjustable on the keyboard - something to take into consideration when trying to preserve battery life. That being said, startup was a nightmare... but this was due largely in part to my internet being down - an essential requirement to get up and running. I\\'m very much a \"plug and play\" kind of guy, so you can imagine my frustration when the computer repeatedly froze on a black screen until I was able to get online to download essential updates and software components (all of which should be pre-installed for a device this new). Trying to add a secondary user was equally frustrating as it also needed to re-download many of the same components as my setup, once again freezing repeatedly. Once past all the initial turmoil, everything was a breeze.\\n\\nExtended use: After a full charge, the battery lasted roughly 2.5-3 hours while I browsed the internet and worked on documents. With streaming and game play, the battery life is surprisingly close to the same (roughly 2 hours depending how much multi-tasking you\\'re doing). The dual fan system is incredibly quiet and kept the laptop from heating more than say your average smartphone after prolonged use.\\n\\nCortana is your virtual assistant (similar to Siri). While she is accessible from your desktop, you can also enable \"Hey Cortana\" in the settings which will allow her to respond to voice commands.\\n\\nLink your phone using the edge app. This allows you to sync browsing history, favorites, and alternate seamlessly between devices (simply by logging into your Microsoft account). It is worth noting the functionality for Apple products is more limited than Android (which allows you to see/sync SMS, MMS, pictures, and video). I have an iPhone, so I cannot personally attest to whether or not the additional Android features actually work, but the information showed up while setting up my device.\\n\\nGame Shift, a function controlled by a button on your keyboard, is said to increase the fan speed to cool the processor, and prioritizes game data over annoying popups or background apps (and updates). Basically, it is supposed to optimize the resources needed during gaming (processor, video card, memory, etc). I attempted to test this function with several games and did not notice a difference or receive the on-screen prompt that it was working. Perhaps I need to update a driver for this? It wouldn\\'t surprise me given the number of essentials I had to install during setup. That being said, the gaming I did was pretty seamless and ran without issues.\\n\\nIt\\'s worth mentioning there is no CD/DVD drive. I completely overlooked this prior to ordering, and the vast majority of my software is on discs. This is easily resolvable with an external drive which costs virtually nothing nowadays.\\n\\nThe webcam has an indicator light next to it to ensure privacy (so you know when it\\'s on). The resolution is average, but consistent with other laptop cams on the market.\\n\\nLastly, a few quick notes. As an avid gamer and video editor, I will say one thing I found discouraging is the computer\\'s memory. Though this is something easily resolved with an external drive, all of these \"plug in\" devices begin to defeat the purpose and simplicity of a laptop. Additionally, the included manual indicates a fingerprint reader on/by the power button... this is NOT a standard feature with all G3 models.\\n\\nSummary: When utilized for office use (or basic functionality) this laptop is superior in terms of speed and software capabilities. For standard gaming it\\'s average, and for the professional gamer it might be underwhelming in some of the areas outlined above. Still, when put to the test it\\'s a reliable laptop that I\\'d consider a nice addition to Dell\\'s product line.',\n",

Biggest con for me which if I knew I would of NOT bought this laptop\\nAnti-Ghosting - You cannot press more than 3 buttons at the same time. So in a game. If you are holding W to move, A or D to strafe, and maybe holding CTRL to crouch you cannot do any other command. I've noticed in Apex Legends Ill try to Jump out of a sprinting slide and the jump wont register. Or playing a MMO I may be holding WD to strafe move. and need to hold SHIFT and press 1 to use a ability and it wont register because its to many keys at once. This for me is a deal breaker to be honest. However for MOST games you wont notice. But the games I frequent the most its very noticeable.\\n\\n2. Audio is pretty lackluster, It has good clarity but almost no bass whatsoever. I highly recommend headphones.\\n\\n3. Fan Noise. When Non-gaming its very quiet. However booting up even a very non demanding game the laptop starts screaming at you. Which also contributes to the bad Audio since the fans are VERY loud. Easily the loudest of any laptop I've owned.\\n\\n4. FN Key - Their is a FN key on the bottom left of the keyboard between Ctrl and Windows key. And I press it ALL the time on accident when trying to press Ctrl.

I'm someone who moves around/travels around a lot for work so I bought a slimmer laptop that only has 1 HDMI port.

The only thing to not is that yes there is a lot of weight on your screen so if you tip the screen forward of backward too much it will topple over, but I adapted to this fairly quickly and just made sure not to let it topple over thats all.

However I knew this in advance as it is clearly stated in product information.\\nDefinitely would recommend this to anyone in a similar position.\",\n",
       " \"After looking online for options, this one seemed to have the better mounting options. I can feel confident that the monitors secure very well to the main monitor. Though it hasn't been a problem for me, I can see where a kickstand should have been a part of the design. I am using these on a 15.1 laptop, so they are a little smaller than I'd like, but the screens have a scale option that helps. I typically stage my teams on one and outlook on the other, so I can use my main screen for real-time work.\\nThere are a couple of features that would improve this greatly:\\n1) larger screen options\\n2) Kickstands. The only reason I don't have troubles is because I have mine attached to a bigger laptop, if it was mounted to anything smaller, I could see this being a big problem.\\n3) Rotating screens so that they can be better protected and stay on the laptop during transport, having to mount/unmount every time it is used almost defeats the purpose of having.\\n4) Better cable options! The monitors are powered through their usb c ports- and possibly the usb 3.0 at bottom. Given the variety of laptops that this is able to support, it is hard to see this improving. I’m hoping that I can eliminate two cables for 1 via a laptop dp to monitor usb c. These are ideal for a user with two c ports, which I sadly do not have.\\n5) Portability. In general, this applies to all of the above. I think the designer tried to maximize the ability to adapt to a range of laptop sizes and sort of ignore the problems of leaving the unit attached during transit. This is a mistake. No one wants to constantly remove/attach these monitors and have to lug around numerous cable options. I do realize that improving on this is tricky since it could box them out of specific monitor sizes/ports/etc, but it’d be better to fill that gap sooner rather than later since once the laptop manufacturers catch on to this, it’ll be a factory-of-origin feature anyhow. I’ve seen competitor designs that account for this better, but they sacrifice on the mounting solution front, however they also include kickstands. I have yet to see one that covers all flawlessly, unfortunately.\\nOverall- a good buy. Buyers- know your laptop before buying. Make sure that your laptop can support 3 display inputs.\",\n",

But I found it was only temporary and the average with a decent fan curve was around 69 to 75C on both cpu and gpu.\\nPredator sense software built in is useful. But I still downloaded MSI afterburner for in game over lay though.\\nCons:\\nFans get pretty loud when you activate turbo. So if you got a decent headset and nobody around you it won’t bother you. But if your around people they will think you have a jet engine running. But even without turbo mode you get more than playable frame-rates in every game I’ve played.

It’s maybe an hr usage if you’re playing heavy games and 7 hrs if you keep power saver mode on and only use it for light work like google chrome or YouTube.\\n\\nOther aspects:\\nScreen was nothing special. Not super bright but not excessively dark or glare issues. Keyboard is fine. Again, nothing special. It’s a laptop. Bloatware wasn’t too bad. Just uninstalled it all. But overall it is a quick responsive little laptop for easy gaming and even can do some work. I’m very satisfied because I’m a trucker on the road everyday and needed something a little more portable but still had performance to play the newer games without going to a 2 grand or more computer. I would recommend it to others.\\n\\nEdit: I forgot to say the pictures are without turbo and with turbo on 3D mark timespy score.',\n",

I have pushed this thing to its limits Days Gone PC version that's just released on the 18th I can play MAXED OUT setting on everything and it never dipped below 90fps and my average was around 124-127fps, this thing is just as powerful as my RTX 2070 Super Gaming X Trio gpu in my one desktop, I own an RTX 2080 Ti, RTX 3080 but they're all Desktop Gpu's but it definitely gives the 2070 Super Desktop GPU some good competition without a doubt. And it's Ampere 8nm architecture so newest Nvidia technology compared to 12nm Turing architecture, and the screen is absolutely gorgeous playing day or night with a true IPS display running at 144Hz @ 3ms, if you want a SOLID GOOD LAPTOP FOR GAMING, this is it, the ACER Predator Helios 300 can't be beat and I own Asus/Origin/Dell etc etc laptops as well and nothing ever Beats my ACER LAPTOPS, and this beauty is made of a nice metal and sturdy plastic on certain parts but mostly metal and u can see the quality ACER put into this laptop, and yes the PREDATOR symbol on the screen lights up and its perfect for letting others know you mean business lol I recommend 100% for the bang for your buck!

       " 'I thought that this laptop would be junk, because most of them that cost less than $300 are junk. But it\\'s actually really good for the price, it definitely does have some limitations related to performance, but for for $250, I think this is a nice laptop for web browsing and simple applications. This is not for gaming or CPU intensive tasks, it can basically do what chromebooks can do, but with the advantage of being able to run windows apps from the Microsoft store and from the web. You have to turn off \"S Mode\", to be able to install apps from the web, but it\\'s really simple and it will prompt you, the first time you try to run an .exe file.\\n\\nThe exterior is really modern looking and has a light blue color, which gives the laptop a unique and refreshing look to it. The screen is your basic 1366x768 LCD panel, the cheaper TN kind of display that you will find on almost all laptops that cost less than $400. It doesn\\'t have the best viewing angles and the colors shift when you are too far off axis of looking at it from a 90 degree angle. It\\'s not all that vibrant or pretty, but to be honest, this is the kind of screen you get at this price point, it is what it is. Webcam is also your run of the mill, 640x480 (0.3 Megapixel), potato camera. This is actually slightly lower resolution than a typical webcam which are usually 1280x720. At least there is a nice bright LED to indicate that the camera is being accessed, this is a good privacy feature. The keyboard is above average for this price, I actually like it. Typing on it isn\\'t bad at all, the white letters against the black keys make it pretty easy to see in low light. The trackpad is made from plastic, but it is a nice size and is smooth to scroll on and easy to click. It\\'s programmed with the standard gestures used in Windows 10. I have seen worse trackpads on more expensive laptops. The screen can tilt way back on this, I really like this feature, it won\\'t go all the way around like a 2 in 1, but farther than a lot of laptops.\\n\\nThe internal specs are kind of ruff to be honest, but I\\'m trying to remind myself that for the price, this is about average. Intel Celeron N4020, this is a dual core CPU that is pretty much an entry level processor. It\\'s not very fast, but it will do what it needs to do for anything you do on the web using a browser, as well as handling simple applications like Microsoft word or playing videos locally using a media player like VLC. It shouldn\\'t have too much of a problem with Zoom or Skype calls. This laptop doesn\\'t have a fan, so it\\'s passively cooled. Playing games like Fortnight or Warzone is just not gonna be possible for this laptop. It only has 4GB of RAM, and 64GB of storage (half of which is already taken up by Windows). There is no way to upgrade the storage or anything else here, the way it comes out of the box is what you are stuck with. But as long as you just need a laptop for basic, everyday tasks, then this computer will be fine for that. I normally use a laptop with a quad-core i7 from 2020, and this laptop doesn\\'t feel that much slower for loading webpages or launching apps. I noticed that windows updates aren\\'t as fast, but that\\'s probably because the storage is eMMC based instead of NVMe (SSD). I recommend getting an external SSD, or at least a USB flash drive, to have more storage for files and apps. It has a Micro SD slot too, but I would advise you to use what I mentioned instead of a Micro SD card, because it will be a lot faster using the USB ports. The USB ports are 3.2 gen 1 (formerly known as 3.0), so they can transfer data at up to 5 Gigabits per second. This is much faster than the Micro SD slot will be (assuming you are using an external SSD). If you are only gonna buy a flash drive, then there won\\'t be much of an advantage over using Micro SD cards. There is also an HDMI port if you want to connect an additional monitor, or just use a larger one.\\n\\nThis laptop isn\\'t a powerhouse, and it lacks a lot of the bells and whistles you would get on a premium laptop. But not everyone needs the extra power and high end features. This is a good laptop that will serve you well, as long as you understand what it\\'s intended for. There are plenty of laptops our there that cost more than this and offer the same thing or even less, I think this Lenovo Ideapad 1 is a good value for the money. It\\'s modern looking with smaller sized bezels around the screen and has a good keyboard.\\n\\nPros+\\n\\nNice modern looking design with cool blue color\\n\\nAffordable\\n\\nGood keyboard and trackpad\\n\\nThin, lightweight, and quiet\\n\\nDecent battery life (6-8 hours)\\n\\nDecent port selection (2x USB A@5Gbps, Micro SD, HDMI, 3.5mm Aux jack)\\n\\nIncludes $80 of extra value, Microsoft 365 personal subscription for 12 months (can be added to 5 devices)\\n\\nCons-\\n\\nCeleron 4020 paired with 4GB of RAM limits what you can do with this laptop\\n\\nNo way to upgrade the RAM or Storage\\n\\nOnly 64GB of eMMC storage',\n",

       " 'For those who have been around computers for a while a topic usually comes up about Lenovo actually being IBM, and hence there is some sort of association of a certain prestige of quality in their minds. The discussion could go on for days but the simple answer is that they are not the same company, but when the focus shifts to opinions, my opinion is that over the years Lenovo has remained one of the better names associated with laptop computers. Remember, I say this as an opinion, there is no real world way to back such statements up by anybody. Like other prestige brand names that usually means you can expect to pay a little more for this one than a no name product. That’s why what I just said becomes important because it leads to another personal opinion that this particular product is overpriced for the technology it delivers and that makes me wonder who would buy it and why. The biggest limitation is that the operation system is the S version of Windows and if I’m paying this much I don’t want the limitations associated with this version. The alone puts me on the edge whether I would recommend it to someone else. That’s not the only limitation – unfortunately these days Windows-compatible software is still as bloated as it ever was back twenty years ago or so and a 64GB SSD attached to the mainboard is painfully small. The other specs aren’t that impressive either, but let’s say they are at least adequate. You can’t upgrade or add any additional memory either. I feel limited in a similar way by the permanently installed battery. I know that’s common on phones and tablets but this is a laptop and as such I expect more connectivity, more upgradeability and more configurability, at least at this price point.\\n\\nWINDOWS S LIMITATIONS\\n\\nI’m not going to dwell on the complicated topic of what the pros and cons are of Windows S, there are countless articles available online to give you the information you need. To me it boils down mostly to the fact that you can only use apps that you get from the Microsoft store. Yes there are thousands of them and for a large segment of users that would never be an issue but if there are apps, even one of them, that are unique and not available in the store, or if your work or play requires using a browser other than Edge – which is the only one you can use - that can make owning this laptop useless.\\n\\nDEALBREAKERS OR NOT\\n\\nIf you’ve read to this point, don’t stop now, you need to know why everything I’ve talked about so far aren’t ironclad deal breakers, there is still a lot in the plus column going for this laptop, let’s list them. I’m going to assume that the person who buys this item knows and understands that this is geared more toward someone who is going to use it for internet, email, and word processing than as a graphics workstation or for rugged road warrior use. That puts the focus on things like how good the keyboard is and how good the screen is and in true Lenovo fashion both are industry leaders. The keyboard is probably the best of any laptop in its class, the shape and arrangement of the keys embarrass many other brands. The keys have a good snap to them with a real keyboard keystroke travel that writers can appreciate. They are nicely sized and arranged for touch typing and top the list of reasons to consider this model. If you are a writer, as I am, and are looking for a lightweight travel companion laptop, put this model on your short list to consider. The screen also is better than I expected for the price. It’s not a great screen but for the tasks I’m describing it is sharp, clear, bright and usable. As far as sound, laptop makers always seem to be trying to put lipstick on it with impressive sounding words and names but in reality we’re still talking about a couple of speakers about the size of your thumbnail that aren’t going to shake, rattle and roll your room but they are fine for video conferencing and most everyday light duty tasks. The camera though is a major disappointment, is it even possible that anyone makes 640 x 480 cameras anymore – even the cheapest toy cell phones are at least 1.3 megapixel. I am more than disappointed how bad the camera is.\\n\\nConnectivity is also at a bare minimum, with only two USB ports and one HDMI port and a multifunction audio in and out connection.\\n\\nBUILD QUALITY\\n\\nThis is another area where my expectations are high, in fact to me the whole word ThinkPad itself translates to road warrior ruggedness, back in the day with IBM owned that trademark that is why companies and individuals paid top dollar for them, they were as close to bulletproof as our reasonable budgets could afford. My very first impression of this model is that is carries the tradition fairly well, I say fairly well because as soon as I touched it the top of the case snapped into place, it came off the assembly line that way and no one bothered to check it or snap it fully into place, but overall it feels a notch better than the other brands in this price range. But it should, they’re asking me to pay more for that trademark name so I expect them to deliver. I think customers who have used other low priced laptops won’t be disappointed.\\n\\nOne more thing you may want to consider is that while this is a thin and lightweight laptop, it is not a class leader in either – I have used several that excel in both specs. I think that falls into the category of personal preference though so I won’t count it as a pro or a con.\\n\\nSUPPORT\\n\\nThere are no guarantees that any company will be around tomorrow after our world has been almost turned upside down recently, but if I had to pick I would say Lenovo has a better chance than most. That’s all I can say about support that means anything, every case is different and my experience is meaningless to you. I recommend not making support a deciding topic to buy or not buy this product based on someone else’s opinion.\\n\\nSUMMARY\\n\\nEverything I know tells me that there is nothing major that should be a barrier to considering this model if your budget allows. It all depends on what you need it for. You really can’t save enough by going with a no name brand to make such penny pinching worthwhile and if you can pay a little bit more I recommend you make sure the memory is upgradable and that you can replace the battery if it needs it. That will probably cost you a hundred to two-hundred more but would be money well spent. My recommendation is to define your needs and then buy it and try it from a place with a good return policy. To sum it all up, this laptop could be just what someone with basic needs is looking for, and I keep coming back to if I was that person I strongly would consider buying one of the last few major brands than a no name product.',\n",

       " ' Acer Aspire 5 - RYZEN 7\\n.\\nThis model was probably the highest priced and the most expensive amongst the other 2 ones that were reviewed. I got it trusting the reviews and saw nothing bad was written about it though only 3 reviews were present.\\n.\\nNow obviously I’m writing this now, after day 2 of using it, rather then month 6 of wear and tear. So far so good. That response should be expected when trying anything new for a short period of time.\\n.\\n.\\n.\\nIssue 1: The speakers sometimes don’t sync with my video or sorta “black out” for a second. But it also just so happens that the computer gets really hot when that happens. So I mean, maybe if it stayed cooler the speakers wouldn’t fade for seconds at a time. I also ran it for about a full day, so a reset and some cool down time helped.\\n.\\nIssue 2: That being said, have something to cool it with. This computer could legitimately burn you it gets so warm. Not the end of the work though, all of my other computers have done that, I’m pretty sure that’s normal unless you have a high-tech device with a built-in fan. So please be wary of that.\\n.\\nIssue 3: The HD camera is 100% HD. I used it for other apps, but what’s seen in my little Zoom camera, the HD is non-exsistent. IDC though because it’s HD where and when it needs to be so :)\\n.\\nIssue 4: The SSD available is about 475 instead of the 500-ish. A little disappointed about that, but all I PERSONALLY needed was 256GB, so I can’t complain at all honestly. But anyone who wanted what they paid for? I’d be wary. I literally searched it’s system preferences the “technical” way by using the hidden commands to find those specific details. The computer blatantly states that all 512 is nowhere to be found, but 475 is. And even of that, about 23GB are already being used. Again though, I don’t really care. Peep the photo to see what I mean.\\n.\\nIssue 5: The RAM’s actually 5-ish GB, not 8. I think that’s a given with any computer, but I’m no tech expert. So I thought I’d key that in. I didn’t do a thorough check on my last computer, but I think my last one was about 6 or 7 of the 8. They both run pretty equivalent despite the major differences. Not sure if upgrading the RAM will start to show it’s superior quality, or if maybe it’s still being broken in for the first week. Who knows.\\n.\\n.\\n.\\nHighlight 1: Backlit. I don’t know why no computer seems to like back lit keyboards, but that’s genuinely something I would turn down a perfectly good computer for. I wan’a be able to work in poor lighting conditions. That said though... I can figure out how to keep the back lit on :( It’ll turn off after awhile.\\n.\\nHighlight 2: The screen quality is SOOOO nice I was shocked. I must’ve thought they were lying or something when they mentioned the high screen resolution because I was astonished at what I saw.. Absolutely beautiful.\\n.\\nHighlight 3: Though it’s not necessarily faster then my original laptop, that might just be my wifi. I thought the 7 would be a drastic improvement in processing speed and whatever else I read the expert’s write, but I can’t tell. Again though, it’s available storage and RAM is not optimal either so maybe that’s change if I upgrade those? Really, really not bad at all though! It runs AutoCad, Rhino, and other heavy, heavy applications with little issue! It’s also excellent at multitasking thus far, minor issues considered. I can’t speak for gaming, but I’d like to imagine that those programs are definitely for higher functioning computers- nothing a mac could handle :)\\n.\\nHighlight 4: All its parts and pieces where in order upon receiving it. I’m pretty sure I ordered brand new(I know that’s so bad of me to not remember). If I didn’t for whatever reason, the packaging and computer has like- no sign of use prior. Even it’s battery life, which is usually a very good indicator of used or new, shows no tampering. If you aren’t aware of what that little trick it, try it on your phone! So for Apple for example, you have the battery life- I’m on 82% right now.\\n\\nThen, inside settings < Battery < Batter Health, you’ll notice that it’s not 100%. Mine’s 90%. Meaning that as I’ve used it, it’s maximum capacity has gone down. Basically stating the battery has had wear to it. As it continues to decrease, the phone may shut down at 3% instead of 0%, or take 10 minutes instead of 5 to recharge from 0%. Things like that.\\n\\nI’m not entirely sure if I found it in the right place, but I didn’t see anything stating the battery’s life was diminished, so surely its as new as promised!\\n.\\nHighlight 5: I saw some reviews on the Ryzen 3 talk about a crappy mic and camera, which scared me for the 7, but so far both are excellent quality. Works really really well. The sound is also excellent. If it doesn’t sound good, either something is faulty- OR it’s on MONO. Mono is a sin IDC and it makes the laptop sound like poor quality looks. Please do yourself a favor and fix that in settings.\\n.\\nHighlight 6: Battery life’s pretty cool. I mean, I didn’t formally test it, but I can’t complain from what I’ve seen.\\n.\\n.\\n.\\nAll in all, I’m super excited to see what months are to come. My best laptop was actually a Mac and it ran me for about 4 years, probably longer if I hadn’t passed it down to my mentee. My last one was an HP and it absolutely fell apart when I dropped it accidentally back in early May. That one would’ve lasted me about a year. Some people have Laptops for a few months, others 10 years. I guess I’ll see. Oh, and obviously, for the price I’d like to believe this is pretty darn great so far.\\n\\nI’d recommend it. Just be sure to 100% check all its features before you start gettin’ all attached- that way issue or bugs can be caught immediately, reported, and replaced. Take photos and videos too between the unboxing to any unexpected errors; cover all your bases :)',\n",

I like to listen to music or have multiple apps/tabs open sometimes so the RAM upgrade was a must for me. 4 out of 5 stars just because the little amount of RAM it comes with.

I have upgraded it with an OKN AX200 wifi adapter and fixed an extra aux antenna as there was only 1 antenna in the original card. I have also put WD 1TB NVME SSD. Boot time on Linux mint is 12 seconds and apps run amazingly smooth. designing is beautiful. No complaints so far. The screen is a big let down but that's the best you can get for the price.

       " 'I was searching for a new laptop with a 3:2 ratio screen at a 14\" size, but didn\\'t want to spend $1,000. I discovered that 3:2 ratio screen sized laptops are hard to come by at a reasonable price. I ran into an article on a Chuwi laptop that used an Intel i3 processor on a website search, but had never heard of the brand. The site directed me to Amazon and I discovered an upgraded version, the Corebook X. This laptop uses an Intel i5, albeit one that is a few generations old. Nevertheless, I thought I\\'d give it a try since it also has a 3:2 ratio 14\" screen.\\n\\nI must say, I\\'m quite impressed with this laptop. Build quality is excellent, the screen is vivid with good contrast and color accuracy. It is thin and light but rugged as it is encased in metal. No screen flex and the keyboard is superb. The i5 processor is speedy as applications and websites snap open instantly, with no lag whatsoever. The m.2 SSD is a real plus, and an easily accessible door on the bottom provides a slot for adding an additional one.\\n\\nThe good stuff:\\n- The 3:2 ratio screen in a 14\" laptop hits the sweet spot for me. It provides excellent screen real estate and reduces constant scrolling. Not a gamer\\'s screen, but for business use it is excellent. Videos are amazing, albeit with a 1/2\" black bar above and below. Not a big deal for me.\\n- The i5 processor, 16gb of ram, and 256gb m.2 SSD put this laptop over the edge almost into premium category. And, the ability to easily add a second SSD is a real plus.\\n- Sturdy, all-metal case with a flat finish that resists fingerprints.\\n- The 3:2 screen size lengthens the laptop that allows for a HUGE trackpad that is smooth and responsive. And, it\\'s centered!!!\\n- Keyboard layout and feel are excellent. No misfires when using it. I really appreciate that it\\'s backlit, and is only on when using the keys.\\n- Plain old Windows 10 Home without bloatware of any kind! Thank you Chuwi!!!!\\n- All driver updates were accomplished through Windows update. No need to go to the manufacturers\\' website to get updates.\\n- Strong wifi connection using an Intel wifi radio.\\n- No screen ghosting like I\\'ve experienced on other laptops.\\n- I use Samsung dex on my Galaxy s10e, and it\\'s plug-and-play on this laptop through the USB-C port. No docking station needed. It immediately identified the Samsung dex functionality of my phone and downloaded the apps and drivers instantly.\\n- Fairly fast battery recharging time up to about 90% in 2-hours from 10%.\\n- I emailed a question about the laptop to Chuwi and they responded almost immediately! Excellent customer service.\\n\\nNot so much:\\n- Battery life is just OK. It uses a 43 amp-hour battery that is smaller than my 55 amp-hour Dell XPS 12 that I purchased in 2013, but gets about the same usage time. Not bad, but the Dell isn\\'t all that great either. However, the Chuwi does have a larger and brighter screen, so there\\'s that. So far, I get about 4-5 hours with constant use including heavy web access. That\\'s about exactly what Chuwi\\'s website proclaims, so no exaggeration there.\\n- The two speakers on the bottom are weak and sound tinny.\\n- A little stingy on ports. Only one USB-3 and one USB-C. There is a micro-SD slot, but I don\\'t foresee a need for that myself. It may be useful to someone who transfers a lot of photos and files to other devices without using the USB port.\\n- The power supply connector seems a bit weak. It appears that it could be easily damaged with a sudden tug on the cable. I would have preferred a magnetic connector to avoid any accidental problems.\\n-There is no light to indicate the laptop is in standby mode when the lid is closed. Also, just like with most other laptops currently, there is no light to indicate the drive is being accessed.\\n- Opening the lid takes a bit of getting used to unless one has long fingernails.\\n- Uses an older Intel processor that was released in 2017 and the m.2 SSD is not NVME. This is not an impediment to it\\'s overall performance and probably helps keep its price down.\\n- Uses a glossy screen, which is good news; bad news. It provides a sharp picture, but highly reflective under certain lighting conditions.\\n\\nOverall, I\\'m very pleased with this laptop. No quirkiness of any sort so far. Every other laptop I\\'ve purchased required further driver development to get rid of problems, including from Dell and HP.\\n\\nThis laptop takes full advantage of Windows 10 functionality and provides a superb user experience. It\\'s safe to say that with a little bigger battery this would be an exceptional laptop that could keep up with much more expensive models. I\\'ve only been using it for two days, so long-term use will be a critical factor. Nevertheless, I highly recommend it.',\n",
       " 'I was looking for an inexpensive laptop that I can use to run a Linux OS version, well this is the product. I purchased a WD Blue M.2 NVMe drive to add to the CHUWI Corebook X14 using an easily accessible external hatch on the bottom of the laptop, completed the install in a matter for a few minutes. I am partial to Ubuntu since I presently run it on my desktop so I went on a search for an improved Ubuntu, well I found it is called Pop!OS 20.10 based on Ubuntu 20.10. I proceeded to install and create a bootable Pop!OS instance on the newly installed NVMe SSD. It is working flawlessly on the CHUWI Corebook X. Everything works including my DisplayLink Docking Station.\\nThis is a very nice little latpop for the value with an excellent display! I wished the processor was a little faster on the laptop but I also realize that CHUWI is trying to maintain a reasonable price point.\\nChuwi advertises a theoretical battery life of 9 hours however with my normal use and the settings i am averaging between 4 to 5 hours.',\n",

Also second slot supports M.2 NVMe but only at PCI Express 3.0 x4 speed. For that slot I used a Samsung 970 NVMe SSD.\\n\\nFirst slot only supports SATA, which is only accessible by removing the entire back cover. The second slot supports SATA or an NVMe drive. Remember that when buying your drives! Recommend installing the Samsung NVMe driver from their website.\\n\\nAn NVMe drive in the first slot will not be detected in the bios. To get into bios tap the ESC key multiple times after holding the power button to turn laptop on.\\n\\nProcessor supports VT-x so running virtual machines with hardware virtualization is great. VirtualBox and LDplayer work well.\\n\\nCame with Windows 10 1909 installed. I upgraded to pro version and then used Windows 10 Upgrade assistant program to manually upgrade to 20H2. No issues.\\n\\nBasic games work well and call of duty mobile works pretty good on LDplayer.\\n\\nAlso great as a travel laptop. With 16gb ram for this price you cannot go wrong. I appreciate the quality of the glass screen as well. It is reflective but the 2k resolution looks very sharp on the display.\\n\\nLaptop fan kicks on about 43-48c. I've gotten it up to 75c and no issues. Does get quite warm on the bottom. Fan noise could be more quiet. It does have a certain whine which I wish was more quite under constant load.\\n\\nThe clicking of the touch pad is quite loud. I recommend only tapping the touch pad. I did get an external mouse for faster multi tasking and light gaming.\\n\\nAll latest drivers can be manually downloaded from microsoft update catalog to by searching the hardware ID.\\n\\nI do enjoy using this laptop.

Set up was very easy and it was packaged nicely too. I will write more when I have used it for awhile. It does have windows 10 S. I need to get rid of that to play the games I already have but will let you know how well that works out.',\n",

Now that I have used it awhile I am not 100% sure I like the \"S mode\". It does have it\\'s pros and cons, so read up on Windows 10 S before you buy this computer. You can turn off the S mode and run full version of Windows 10, but there is no going back if you do. I have decided to continue using the S mode, because I am not sure this system meets hardware requirements to run the full version of Windows 10. I\\'m not at all \\'geeky\\' enough! :)',\n",

But it's still very light and has a decent battery life which makes it super portable. I really only use it for drawing or watching videos but I could see it being useful for school work and such. The keyboard does also feel a bit cheap but really only noticable when you click on the trackpad- which is why I use a mouse! Overall, if it's a good computer really just depends on what you want to use it for.\",\n",

I only gave it two processors and 4 Gig of ram. Installing virutal box guest extensions did not work out well though due to debian missing kernel headers.\\n\\nI just ordered a USB Wifi dongle that supports Linux.
